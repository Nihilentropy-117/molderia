## The Atrium Locket

This ancient locket houses a shard of [Silver_Atrium](../Places/Silver_Atrium.md)of [HIELCIOFNONA](../Places/HIELCIOFNONA.md), granting its wearer the ability to forge connections between disparate timelines and locations. 


---
Fueled by the affinity between the Old Ones, the locket operates through a mystical synergy with the [Infinite Library](../Places/Infinite_Library.md) that reveals a vast network of unseen conduits.
