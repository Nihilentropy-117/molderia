## D'atta's Clockwork Oracle

The Clockwork Oracle is a complex, brass-and-gears contraption invented by [Datta](../People/Datta.md), the mad hatter who finds himself lost in the [Gothic Mountains](../Places/Gothic%20Mountains.md). The device uses bits of ancient technology salvaged from the [Chronotide Marshlands](../Places/Chronotide_Marshlands.md) to decipher the cryptic patterns reflected in the [Prismglass_Gardens](../Places/Prismglass_Gardens.md). The Oracle can predict probable futures; however, the Oracle has its own sentience and may choose to reveal only what it deems necessary, making it both revered and feared by those who seek its wisdom.
