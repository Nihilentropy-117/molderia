## Thal'loren, the Whispering Wind

Thal'loren, the Whispering Wind, is the divine embodiment of the intangible and unseen, revered by those seeking communion with the natural world, such as [Elsira Ravenshadow](../People/Elsira_Ravenshadow.md) and her eco-defenders of [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon_Vale.md). Thal'loren governs over the secrets carried on the wind and whispers untold stories to those with open hearts in the [Whispering_Garden](../Places/Whispering_Garden.md). The deity speaks through the leaves and rose petals that adorn the Solarium of Whispers, offering cryptic insights to [Kalinda_the_Bard](../People/Kalinda_the_Bard.md). It was Thal'loren who aided [Grendel the Greyscale](../People/Grendel_Greyscale.md) in breaking the chains of servitude to Thuldrin Kreed, allowing his pursuit of freedom and justice.
