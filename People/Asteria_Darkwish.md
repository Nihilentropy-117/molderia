## Asteria Darkwish

A cunning human rogue-turned-arcane trickster, Asteria spent her early years pilfering trinkets from the stalls of the [Serpents_Eye_Oasis](../Places/Serpents_Eye_Oasis.md). Her affinity for sleight of hand eventually led her to discover the ethereal song that unlocks the [Shattered_Gate](../Places/Shattered_Gate.md), releasing magical anomalies from within. Now, haunted by the consequences of her actions and bearing intricate tattoos imbued with the Song's power, Asteria seeks redemption by assisting the eco-defenders of [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon_Vale.md).
