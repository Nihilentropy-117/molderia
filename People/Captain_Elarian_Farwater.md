## Captain Elarian Farwater

A seasoned airship captain, Elarian survived a harrowing encounter with the vengeful [Pirate Wilp](../People/Pirate_Wilp.md) and his spectral crew. Now haunted by the memories of that battle, he seeks to cleanse this supernatural threat from the skies. Learning of the [Necromancers_Tower](../Places/Necromancers_Tower.md), he hopes to strike a bargain with [Djimm](../People/Djimm.md), believing that the tower's master holds the key to [Pirate Wilp](../People/Pirate_Wilp.md)'s ultimate defeat.
