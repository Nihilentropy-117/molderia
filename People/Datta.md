## Dâ€™atta

D'atta, hatter of worlds and native outsider, has been disconnected from his home area for 1500 years and is now adrift in multiverse. He briefly inspired Alice in Wonderland and now rests in northeast mountains, accessible through anomaly in Greyskull Castle's basement. Though considered mad, he is skilled inventor. His secret and current status are unknown.
