## Faelor Nightshade

[Faelor Nightshade](../People/Faelor_Nightshade.md) is a tabaxi bard who uncovered a mystical lyre within the [Ethereal_Bazaar](../Places/Ethereal_Bazaar.md), allowing him to masterfully play the time-worn melody to open the Shattered Gate. Hailing from [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon_Vale.md), Faelor's thirst for adventure and newfound musical powers led him to seek out the secretive order of knights residing in the [Lunarspire Citadel](../Places/Lunarspire_Citadel.md). Deeply inspired by the enchanting tales of [Thalloren_the_Whispering_Wind](../Gods/Thalloren_the_Whispering_Wind.md), Faelor travels the realm, using his extraordinary abilities to soothe troubled souls.
