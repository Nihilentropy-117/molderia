## Jeepit the Time-Bound

[Jeepit the Time-Bound](../People/Jeepit_Time-Bound.md) is an enigmatic figure renowned for his mastery of time manipulation and his deep understanding of its intricacies. Born to an unknown ancient species, legend has it that Jeepit was bound to time itself as the result of an encounter with an ancient artifact under mysterious circumstances. With a lifetime centuries-long, if not more, Jeepit managed to unlock secrets beyond the comprehension of any mortal being. Operating the magical shop, [Jeepit Clocks](../Places/Jeepit_Clocks.md), he provides a unique service to the realm by selling magical clocks and other time-related artifacts. Yet, not all of his actions are altruistic. Behind his seemingly innocuous clock shop, Jeepit harbors a hidden agenda involving the exploitation of various power centers across the realm. One might ask whether Jeepit manipulates events from behind the scenes, shaping the destinies of heroes to further his aims - and if so, to what end? Does Jeepit seek to control time for his own dominion, or is he a guardian, ensuring that time's ebb and flow remains unaltered by sinister forces?
