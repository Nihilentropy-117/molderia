## Kaelen Strongbrew

A hardy dwarf ranger and skilled alchemist who discovered the secret access to [The_Lady](../Gods/The_Lady.md)'s casino and incurred her wrath. Knowing he cannot outsmart the Goddess of Luck, Kaelen travels through the mountains of [Bork](../Places/Bork.md), forging alliances among the dwarven clans and seeking assistance to restore balance to the luck bestowed upon him.
