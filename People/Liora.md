## Liora

Liora is a resourceful human wizard who left her home in [Targallene](../Places/Targallene.md) in search of forbidden arcane knowledge. Joined by her trusty raven familiar, she now explores the shattered remnants of Sudi and the [Azlanti Ruins](../Places/Azlanti_Ruins.md). However, her obsession with the Prophecies of the Narrative and the cryptic clues they hold may lead her down a dangerous path, where she risks drawing the attention of dark and ancient powers.
