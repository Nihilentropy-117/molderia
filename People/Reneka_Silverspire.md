## Reneka Silverspire

Reneka, a gifted skyship engineer, was enlisted by [Captain Elarian Farwater](../People/Captain_Elarian_Farwater.md) to maintain his vessel and find a way to pierce the spectral defenses of [Pirate Wilp](../People/Pirate_Wilp.md)'s ship. She devised a method to weave elemental magic into the ship's workings. Reneka's mastery of mechanical wonders has piqued the curiosity of [Villalobos](../People/Villalobos.md), who offered her an esteemed, secretive place in his workshop. Will she be able to pursue her craft to the fullest or uncover dark truths lying beneath the surface of [Bork](../Places/Bork.md) markets?
