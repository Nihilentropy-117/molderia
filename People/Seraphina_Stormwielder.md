## Seraphina Stormwielder

Seraphina, a changeling sorceress, chanced upon a fragment of [Ilianna Stormbringer](../People/Ilianna_Stormbringer.md)'s essence during her travels, and, in doing so, acquired the prowess to control storm magic. Her latest quest has led her to the [Whispering_Garden](../Places/Whispering_Garden.md), deciphering crucial links between the [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md) standing stones and the ancient empire's relics rumored to be scattered across the [Shattered_Colonies](../Places/Shattered_Colonies.md). Seraphina's ever-changing identity and mastery over the elements have made her a valuable, albeit unpredictable, ally to [Elira Windrider](../People/Elira_Windrider.md) and her gryphon companion, Stormwing. But her alignment with [The_Lady](../Gods/The_Lady.md)'s purpose remains uncertain, rendering her true intentions inscrutable.
