## Shadra Stoneshaper

Shadra Stoneshaper, a goliath druid from the [Crimson Heights](../Places/Crimson_Heights.md), stumbled upon an ancient [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md) stone circle while exploring the depths of [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon_Vale.md). Combining her knowledge of earth magic with the circle's latent power, Shadra manipulates the land to defend her village from encroaching daemon forces.
