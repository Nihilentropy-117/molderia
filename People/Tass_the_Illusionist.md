## Tass the Illusionist

[Tass the Illusionist](../People/Tass_Illusionist.md), a cunning gnome with a knack for deception, serves as a mediator between the barmy brainiac [Villalobos](../People/Villalobos.md) and the inscrutable [Djimm](../People/Djimm.md). Having grown up amidst the bustling [Bork](../Places/Bork.md) markets, Tass's unquenchable thirst for power led him to dabble in ancient magics and unsavory alliances. Holding the key to the entrance of the [Secret_Barrow_of_Souls](../Places/Secret_Barrow_of_Souls.md), Tass is sought after by heroes and villains alike, who hope to harness his knowledge for their own purposes.
