## The Dread Bog of Mogolo

Shrouded in an eternal twilight in the Jungle region of Mogolo lies the sinister Dread Bog. The air is thick with the scent of decay, betraying the lurking presence of ancient, malevolent entities drawn to the corruption. Daring adventurers who venture into the black morass may discover secrets concealed within the corrupt waters and twisted vegetation, but are constantly watched by the unfathomable gaze of the Old Ones and haunted by the lost souls entwined in the grasp of the mire.
