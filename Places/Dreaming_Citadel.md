## The Dreaming Citadel

Floating among the clouds above [Targallene](../Places/Targallene.md), this enigmatic fortress houses the tear of [[The Lady](../Gods/The_Lady.md)](../Gods/The_Lady.md), a crystalline artifact reflecting the chaotic balance of fortune's fickle whims. Intricate illusions and mind-bending puzzles defend the artifact, testing the will and intellect of those who seek its power. Those who are favored may harness the tear's essence, but to defy [[The Lady](../Gods/The_Lady.md)](../Gods/The_Lady.md) risks invoking her capricious wrath.
