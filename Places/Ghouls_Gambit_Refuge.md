## Ghoul's Gambit Refuge

The Ghoul's Gambit Refuge is a hidden underground chamber connected to the infamous [Ghouls_Gambit](Ghouls_Gambit.md) gambling den. Offering sanctuary to those who pay with fragments of fate, the chamber contains relics linked to [The_Lady](../Gods/The_Lady.md). Here, weary souls find respite from pursuit, provided they can resist the whispers seeking to sway their path.
