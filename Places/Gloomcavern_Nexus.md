## Gloomcavern Nexus

Concealed within the shadows of [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon_Vale.md), the [Gloomcavern Nexus](../Places/Gloomcavern_Nexus.md) is an underground subterranean network whose twisting passages span for miles beneath the forest floor. It serves as a secret meeting spot for the enigmatic Agents of the [Council_of_Seven](../Lore/Council_of_Seven.md), where they discuss their clandestine activities safely hidden from prying eyes.
