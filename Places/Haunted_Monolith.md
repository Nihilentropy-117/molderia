## The Haunted Monolith

In the wastelands north of [Bork](../Places/Bork.md), beyond the stinging snow and unforgiving scrubland, a lone obsidian Monolith stands - a beacon of respite in the barren wilderness. Within its walls harbor the restless spirits of an ancient civilization, tormented whispers of untold stories and forgotten prophecies. Many travelers have sought refuge there, only to find themselves ensnared in a maelstrom of sorrow, echoing forth the echo of a past that refuses to be silenced.
