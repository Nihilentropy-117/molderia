## Ja'To

Ja'To, the City of Winds, is known for its high, wind-swept towers that rise majestically out of the desert. These towers, intricately carved with ancestral stories, serve as both homes and lookouts for the vigilant inhabitants. Ja'To's people have mastered the harsh desert winds, using them for wind-powered contraptions and transportation. The "Wind Singers", a group of warriors, have honed the art of manipulating these winds in combat, making them formidable opponents.
