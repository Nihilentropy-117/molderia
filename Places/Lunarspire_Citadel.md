## Lunarspire Citadel

This ancient, moonlit stronghold atop the Nightfall Peak houses a secretive order of knights dedicated to maintaining the balance between light and darkness. Led by a descendant of [Sir_George_DracoLich](../People/Sir_George_DracoLich.md) they protect the realm from the resurgence of powerful evils like [Hastur](../People/Hastur.md), while occasionally seeking guidance from [The_Lady](../Gods/The_Lady.md). Behind its imposing, silver-lined walls, the knights study prophecies from the Book of Narrative, hoping to unearth secrets that may save the world.
