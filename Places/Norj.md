## Norj

Norj stands as a beacon of knowledge and spirituality among the desert cities, nestled in a valley between towering dunes. Its inhabitants, drawn to the mystic arts and ancient lore, are seen as the scholars and seers among the Aielorcs. The city itself is a labyrinth of ancient libraries and meditation chambers, lit by glow-worm lanterns that cast an eerie, yet calming light. Norj is also known for its "Water Witches", skilled oracles who divine the future from the rare desert springs.
