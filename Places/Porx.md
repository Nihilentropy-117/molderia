## Porx

Porx is a city known for its rich mineral mines and skilled blacksmiths. Nestled near the base of a large, rocky outcrop, the city's buildings are built from the desert's iron-rich stones, giving the city an imposing, fortress-like appearance. The people of Porx are tough, their skin as rough as the rocks they mine, and their hearts as warm as the forges they tend. The "Stone Breakers" of Porx are renowned for their ability to shape both metal and stone, crafting weapons and tools of unrivaled quality.
