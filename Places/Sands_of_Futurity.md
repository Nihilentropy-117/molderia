## The Sands of Futurity

[The Sands of Futurity](../Places/Sands_of_Futurity.md) is a peculiar oasis found within [Bummehilldes](../Places/Bummehilldes.md) where time and space become malleable, influenced by the energy of an ancient artifact from the [Infinite Library](../Places/Infinite_Library.md). [Djimm](../People/Djimm.md) and [Jeepit the Time-Bound](../People/Jeepit_Time-Bound.md) have been seen frequenting this location, manipulating the environment as they gather hidden knowledge. Individuals attempting to harness the shattered remnants of time risk unraveling their own personal timeline.
