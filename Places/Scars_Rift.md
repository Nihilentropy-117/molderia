## Scar's Rift

Hidden beneath [Bummehilldes](../Places/Bummehilldes.md)' sands, Scar's Rift is a treacherous network of tunnels and caverns carved by a legendary [Rift Key](../Artifacts/Rift_Key.md). Home to secretive groups attuned to the mysterious artifact's power, they navigate the realm through unconventional portals, stealthily avoiding hostile forces. This enigmatic underground city teems with danger and unwary travelers who stumble upon a [Rift Key](../Artifacts/Rift_Key.md) risk becoming lost in its maze-like depths.
