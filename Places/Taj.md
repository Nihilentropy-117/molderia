## Taj

A city of hardened warriors and sun-baked stone, Taj is a testament to the sheer resilience of the Aielorcs. The city is situated amidst the harsh dunes, with the sun glaring down on its metallic domes and sharp, angular architecture. The buildings are carved into the very bedrock, providing natural cooling against the relentless desert heat. Taj is known for its "Sand Dancers", a warrior caste known for their uncanny ability to move stealthily through the desert, blending seamlessly with the shifting sands.
