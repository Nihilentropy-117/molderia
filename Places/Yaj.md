## Yaj

Yaj, the Mirage City, is almost invisible from a distance, its structures made from reflective glass-like material that blends into the desert. Known for its cunning traders and artisans, Yaj is a city of illusion and intrigue. The intricate mirror labyrinth at its heart serves as a meeting place, reflecting not just the inhabitants, but their dreams and aspirations. The "Glass Walkers" of Yaj are adept at using the city's reflective nature to their advantage, creating illusions in battle that confuse and disorient their enemies.
