## The Azlanti

In the ancient history of Molderia, the seeds of civilization were sown by the Azlanti, an early human tribe of unassuming origins. Life was simple and survival was key until a cosmic entity of uncharted origins decided to interfere with their destiny.

Intrigued by the Azlanti's potential, the entity, which would later be known to be Cthulu, endowed them with powerful Stones imbued with a unique form of magic. Guided by this newfound mystical force, the Azlanti evolved from a state of primitive subsistence to a society of unprecedented splendor and wisdom. They used this power to build colossal cities and nurture a civilization that was second to none in arts, technology, and magical prowess.

However, the Azlanti grew arrogant in their prosperity, viewing themselves as the superior race. They started to neglect the teachings and warnings of the cosmic entity, misusing the Stones' magic in ways that violated the natural order.

In response to their arrogance, the cosmic entity decided to re-calibrate the equilibrium. It hurled a meteor teeming with a mysterious element called [Deucenium](Deucenium.md) towards Molderia. Upon impact, the Deucenium was dispersed across the land in the form of dust. This event became known as the [Deucenium_Impact](Deucenium_Impact.md).

Deucenium was a unique metal, one that had the capability to suppress natural magic and replace it with its own unique energies. The dusting of this element across Molderia had a transformative effect on its inhabitants. The Azlanti, along with the primitive races of Porto-Orcs and Porto-Dwarves, were rapidly altered into their current states.

Post the Deucenium Impact, the world of Molderia and its inhabitants began to exist in a new magical paradigm. No longer reliant on the [Azlanti_Ioun_Stones](../Artifacts/Azlanti_Ioun_Stones.md), the Azlanti, and indeed all of Molderia's inhabitants, found themselves inherently capable of spellcasting, a trait facilitated by living in a land saturated with Deucenium. The Azlanti's fall marked the end of an era but also gave birth to a world where magic was democratically distributed, opening a new chapter in the annals of Molderia.
