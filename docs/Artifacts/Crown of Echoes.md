The Crown of Echoes is an enchanted silver circlet embedded with fragments of the [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md) stones found within the [Whispering Glade](../Places/Whispering_Glade.md). Crafted by [Seladris_Eternal_Soothsayer](../Gods/Seladris%20the%20Eternal%20Soothsayer.md), this artifact grants the wearer the ability to hear and communicate with the whispers of fate shared between the stones.  Though the power of the Crown of Echoes is immense, it takes a strong and disciplined mind to wield the artifact without succumbing to the weight of its boundless knowledge.


---
The crown's mystical link to the ancient ruins and whispered secrets amplifies the wearer's power over time and destiny while simultaneously connecting them to the ancient sages who once transcended the borders of life and death in the [Temple_of_Samsara](../Places/Temple_of_Samsara.md).
