The Crystal Siren's Song, a harp forged from the crystalline structures found in the [Crystal_Caverns](../Places/Crystal_Caverns.md), possesses the ability to replicate the melody needed to activate [Shattered_Gate](../Places/Shattered_Gate.md). Imbued with the power of the ancient [Azlanti](../Lore/Azlanti.md), the harp can produce otherworldly tones that can heal or bewitch those who hear its music. Legend has it that it was once owned by [Ilianna Stormbringer](../People/Ilianna_Stormbringer.md), who used it to unlock a hidden passage within [Ashen_Monastery](../Places/Ashen_Monastery.md). However, whoever wields the harp walks a thin line between becoming enthralled by its seductive song or emerging unaffected with untold power.
