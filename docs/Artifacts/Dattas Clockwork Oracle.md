## D'atta's Clockwork Oracle

The Clockwork Oracle is a complex, brass-and-gears contraption invented by Datta, the mad hatter who finds himself lost in the Gothic Mountains. The device uses bits of ancient technology salvaged from the Chronotide Marshlands to decipher the cryptic patterns reflected in the Prismglass Gardens. The Oracle can predict probable futures; however, the Oracle has its own sentience and may choose to reveal only what it deems necessary, making it both revered and feared by those who seek its wisdom.
