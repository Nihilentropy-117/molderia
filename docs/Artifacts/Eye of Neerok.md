## The Eye of Neerok

The Eye of Neerok is a blood-red, gem-encased sphere allegedly formed from the crystallized essence of the deceased demon [Neerok](../People/Neerok.md). This malevolent artifact is rumoured to grant its bearer control over the skeletal bloodfins lingering in [Eye_of_Hastur](../Places/Eye_of_Hastur.md). A clandestine society dwelling within the [Shattered Sands Bazaar](../Places/Shattered_Sands_Bazaar.md) seeks to recover the Eye, harnessing its power to uncover hidden prophecies and summon forth ancient evils.
