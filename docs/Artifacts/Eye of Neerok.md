## The Eye of Neerok

The Eye of Neerok is a blood-red, gem-encased sphere allegedly formed from the crystallized essence of the deceased demon Neerok. This malevolent artifact is rumoured to grant its bearer control over the skeletal bloodfins lingering in Eye of Hastur. A clandestine society dwelling within the Shattered Sands Bazaar seeks to recover the Eye, harnessing its power to uncover hidden prophecies and summon forth ancient evils.
