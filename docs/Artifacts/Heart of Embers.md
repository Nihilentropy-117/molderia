## The Heart of Embers

Harvested from the heart of the volcano Goth, this blood-red crystal contains the essence of Zorandar the Unyielding Flame. This powerful gem is said to provide its wielder with divine strength, fierce determination, and the power to incite rebellions or quench insurrections. Auron Firebrand found solace in bearing the Heart of Embers while leading the uprising against the tyranny of Baron Lucious D'Nite in Goth’ar’giglas. The crystal is also believed to be the key to unlocking the potential of the volatile magic within the Shattered Tower.
