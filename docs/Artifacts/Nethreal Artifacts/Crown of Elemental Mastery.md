This ornate crown, adorned with elemental symbols, becomes a conduit for the elemental forces of nature when empowered with a Nethrael Stone. It grants the player control over the elements, allowing them to summon and manipulate fire, water, earth, and air. The crown also enhances the player's resistance to elemental damage and provides protection against harmful environmental effects.
