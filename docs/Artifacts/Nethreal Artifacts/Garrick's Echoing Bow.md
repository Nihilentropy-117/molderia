This ethereal bow hums with invisible power. As the player expends Nethrael Stones, the bow anchors listeners to its will. It instantly fires volleys of arcane arrows at the command of the wielder, as thin, shimmering ethereal beings whispering regret and longing to their targets. Sacrificing levels imbues the bow with even more arrows, augments their damage, and grants additional enchantments such as bypassing resistances or snaring opponents with haunting shackles.
