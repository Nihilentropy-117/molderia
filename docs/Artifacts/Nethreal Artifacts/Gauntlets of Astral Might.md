These sturdy gauntlets, when empowered with a Nethrael Stone, grant the player incredible strength and resilience. The gauntlets enhance the player's physical abilities, increasing their melee damage and granting them the ability to deliver devastating blows. They also provide protection against physical attacks and allow the player to temporarily enter an empowered state (as barbarian rage ability), further boosting their combat prowess.
