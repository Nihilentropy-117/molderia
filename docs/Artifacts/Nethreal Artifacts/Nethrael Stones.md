Nethrael Stones are mesmerizing gemstones of vibrant green hues, pulsating with a mysterious energy that holds the fading essence of the Old Ones. These stones are found naturally in the Nethrael's ancestral home of Darkmoon Vale, and their power is deeply intertwined with the land itself.

Unlike the artificial and dirty magic of the Azlanti Stones, Nethrael Stones are conduits of a more natural and harmonious form of magic. The Nethrael, a mystical race of mithral elves, were blessed with inherent magical abilities simply by growing up around these stones. This magic is akin to the druidic or shamanic traditions, drawing power from the natural world and the ley lines that course through it.

Nethrael Stones offer a consistent and varied source of magic. While they may not possess the raw power of the Azlanti Stones, they make up for it with their versatility and reliability. The magic channeled through these stones is clean and pure, allowing users to tap into a wide range of spells and abilities that align with the natural forces of the world.

One of the unique aspects of Nethrael Stones is their ability to enhance and amplify the innate magical abilities of the Nethrael. By attuning to a Nethrael Stone, a spellcaster can tap into its power, unlocking new depths of their magical potential. This attunement process allows the user to access a broader repertoire of spells and abilities, expanding their magical horizons.

Furthermore, Nethrael Stones have a symbiotic relationship with the land of Darkmoon Vale. They draw upon the natural energies of the environment, amplifying the connection between the user and the ley lines. This connection grants the user a heightened awareness of their surroundings and the ability to tap into the latent magic that flows through the land.

It is important to note that Nethrael Stones are not mere tools or trinkets. They are deeply tied to the Nethrael's culture, history, and spiritual beliefs. The stones are revered and treated with great respect, as they are seen as gifts from the Old Ones and a symbol of the Nethrael's connection to the natural world.

Adventurers who seek to harness the power of Nethrael Stones must approach them with reverence and an understanding of the delicate balance between magic and nature. With proper attunement and respect for the natural forces, these stones can unlock a world of magical possibilities and allow the user to become a conduit of the ancient and mystical powers of the Nethrael.

Nethrael Stones possess a unique property that makes them both alluring and dangerous to those who are not of Nethrael descent. If a non-Nethrael attempts to use a Nethrael Stone, it will grant them a surge of power, enhancing one of their skills or abilities. This boost is often significant, allowing the user to surpass their previous limitations and achieve feats they never thought possible.

However, this enhancement comes at a great cost. The moment a non-Nethrael taps into the power of a Nethrael Stone, the stone shatters and dissolves, its essence consumed in the process. This irreversible destruction of the stone is a testament to the unique bond between the Nethrael and their ancestral gems.

The shattered remnants of the stone hold no magical properties and are rendered useless. This serves as a stark reminder that the power of the Nethrael Stones is meant exclusively for those of Nethrael lineage, and attempting to wield it without the proper heritage leads to the loss of both the stone and its potential future benefits.

This aspect of Nethrael Stones adds an element of caution and restraint for adventurers who come across these precious gems. While the allure of a boost in skills or abilities may be tempting, the risk of permanently losing the stone and its inherent magical properties should not be taken lightly.

It is worth noting that there are rare instances where non-Nethrael individuals have managed to harness the power of a Nethrael Stone without triggering its destruction. These cases are exceptional and often involve deep connections to the natural world or a profound understanding of the Nethrael's culture and magic. Such individuals are often regarded as chosen ones or bearers of a unique destiny.
