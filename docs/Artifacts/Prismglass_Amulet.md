## The Prismglass Amulet

[The Prismglass Amulet](../Artifacts/Prismglass_Amulet.md) is an exquisite piece of jewelry made from the enchanted polymers found in the [Prismglass_Gardens](../Places/Prismglass_Gardens.md). Meticulously crafted by the artisans of the [Crimson Heights](../Places/Crimson_Heights.md), this dazzling amulet refracts sunlight to reveal chromatic patterns and prophetic visions. However, harnessing the amulet's power comes with the risk of exposing oneself to the capricious wrath of the narrative.
