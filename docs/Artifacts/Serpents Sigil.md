## The Serpent's Sigil

The Serpent's Sigil, a mysterious artifact taking the form of an ornate serpentine medallion, was one of the hidden treasures retrieved from the Weeping Ruins within the Bummehilldes desert by Kalinda the Bard. It granted her with the ability to command and communicate with serpents and other slithering creatures, as well as shape the sands to form deadly creatures at her will.
