## The Serpent's Sigil

The Serpent's Sigil, a mysterious artifact taking the form of an ornate serpentine medallion, was one of the hidden treasures retrieved from the [Weeping_Ruins](../Places/Weeping_Ruins.md) within the [Bummehilldes](../Places/Bummehilldes.md) desert by [Kalinda_the_Bard](../People/Kalinda_the_Bard.md). It granted her with the ability to command and communicate with serpents and other slithering creatures, as well as shape the sands to form deadly creatures at her will.
