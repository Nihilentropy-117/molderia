## The Starlight Cudgel

The Starlight Cudgel is an intricately crafted, enchanted mace with the power to control the forces of celestial light. It was discovered by [Elsira Ravenshadow](../People/Elsira_Ravenshadow.md) in the [Lost_Sanctuary_of_Eloria](../Places/Lost_Sanctuary_of_Eloria.md) during her exploration within [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon_Vale.md). This magical artifact, gifted by the Goddess of Luck, [The Lady](../Gods/The%20Lady.md), may create and command radiant energies to heal, protect, and destroy darkness while also restoring balance to a wielder's luck. The mace is sought by the half-giant [Dbz](../People/Dbz.md) and the brave dwarf [Kaelen Strongbrew](../People/Kaelen_Strongbrew.md), who believe it can turn the tide in their battles against the forces of darkness.
