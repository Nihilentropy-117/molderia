## The Temporal Tear

The Temporal Tear is an enigmatic amulet crafted from fragments of the [Shattered Gate](../Places/Shattered%20Gate.md) by [Zorandar the Unyielding Flame](../Gods/Zorandar%20the%20Unyielding%20Flame.md). When worn, it grants the wielder control over the shifting sands of time found within the [Singing Crystals of Inderloth](../Places/Singing%20Crystals%20of%20Inderloth.md). Users must be cautious, as manipulating time may attract the attention of [Seladris Eternal Soothsayer](../Gods/Seladris%20the%20Eternal%20Soothsayer.md), and can result in unintended consequences.
