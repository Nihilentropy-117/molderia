## The Temporal Tear

[The Temporal Tear](Temporal%20Tear.md) is an enigmatic amulet crafted from fragments of the [Shattered_Gate](../Places/Shattered_Gate.md) by [Zorandar the Unyielding Flame](Zorandar%20the%20Unyielding_Flame.md). When worn, it grants the wielder control over the shifting sands of time found within the [Singing_Crystals_of_Inderloth](../Places/Singing_Crystals_of_Inderloth.md). Users must be cautious, as manipulating time may attract the attention of [Seladris_Eternal_Soothsayer](Seladris%20the%20Eternal%20Soothsayer.md), and can result in unintended consequences.
