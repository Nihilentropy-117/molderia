## The Temporal Tear

The Temporal Tear is an enigmatic amulet crafted from fragments of the Shattered Gate by Zorandar the Unyielding Flame. When worn, it grants the wielder control over the shifting sands of time found within the Singing Crystals of Inderloth. Users must be cautious, as manipulating time may attract the attention of Seladris Eternal Soothsayer, and can result in unintended consequences.
