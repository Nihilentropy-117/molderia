Araknyss, the Eight-Eyed Elder, is an enigmatic figure in the world of adventuring. As ancient as the tallest trees and as mysterious as the darkest corners of the deepest dungeons, Araknyss exists outside the standard alignments and motivations of most creatures. While he can be fearsome and deadly, his behaviors are often unpredictable and seemingly whimsical.

Araknyss takes the form of a massive, eerily beautiful spider. His shimmering exoskeleton, the color of moonlit silver, is adorned with intricate patterns that glow faintly in the dark. His eight gleaming eyes, reminiscent of polished obsidian, shine with an uncanny intelligence and subtle amusement, belying his true age and power. As an elder being, Araknyss possesses a myriad of powerful abilities. He can phase in and out of the Material Plane at will, shift sizes from that of a common house spider to a monstrous behemoth, and weave webs of magical energy capable of entrapping not only physical beings but spells and spirits as well. His venom can induce a range of effects, from vivid hallucinations to petrification, depending on his mood.

Araknyss possesses a certain indifference to the world at large, focusing primarily on his eccentricities and collection. He has been known to ignore those who do not provoke him, displaying a peculiar fascination with collecting items, most notably left boots. However, it would be a grave mistake to underestimate him due to his quirks. If crossed, Araknyss is a terrifyingly powerful adversary, capable of bending reality to his whim.

Araknyss makes his home within the Webbed Nexus, a trans-dimensional space reached through tears in the fabric of reality. This lair is filled with the various items he has collected throughout the centuries. He is quite territorial and reacts aggressively to those who threaten his hoard. He is a collector first and foremost, but his desire for particular items can sometimes clash with the plans and possessions of adventurers. However, he is not inherently malevolent and can sometimes be persuaded to assist adventurers, usually in exchange for a valuable addition to his collection.
