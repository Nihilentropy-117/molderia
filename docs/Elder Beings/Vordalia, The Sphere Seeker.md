Vordalia, the Sphere Seeker, is a majestic being whose existence transcends the common understandings of space and time. As enigmatic and whimsical as she is wise, Vordalia's motivations can seem quite peculiar to mortal beings. Her cosmic pursuit of spherical objects, whether mundane or magical, defines her presence in the realms.

Vordalia manifests as an ethereal, luminous entity. A veil of stellar lights and celestial nebulae shrouds her, ever-changing and endlessly mesmerizing. A multitude of gentle, radiant eyes adorn her, always fixated on the beauty of spherical objects that have caught her interest.

As an elder celestial, Vordalia wields vast cosmic power. She can manipulate gravity, alter the curvature of space, and even bend light to her will. Her touch can infuse mundane spherical objects with a portion of her celestial energy, transforming them into potent magical artifacts. The intensity of her gaze can transmute matter, turning non-spherical objects into perfect spheres. Despite her immense power, Vordalia is gentle and kind-hearted. She revels in the beauty of spherical objects, pursuing them with a childlike fascination. From the perfect pearl found in an oyster shell to the enchanted orb of a powerful wizard, if it's round, it has surely captured Vordalia's attention. However, do not underestimate her for her peculiar hobby; when roused, she can unleash forces that can bend the cosmos to her will.

Vordalia resides in the Orbicular Oasis, an extra-dimensional realm filled with her vast collection of spheres. From celestial bodies in miniature to orbs of magical power, the variety of her collection is as staggering as its size. She guards her realm with a motherly affection, dealing sternly with those who threaten her precious collection.
