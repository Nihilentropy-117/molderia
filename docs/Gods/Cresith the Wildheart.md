## Cresith, the Wildheart

Cresith, the guardian of Darkmoon Vale, is the deity of the wild, revered by Elsira Ravenshadow and her eco-defenders. Chosen by The Lady as the embodiment of life's unpredictability, Cresith holds dominion over the beasts that roam the woods, from the common to the mythical. Their worship is a testament to the reverence for the chaotic beauty of nature.
