## Cresith, the Wildheart

Cresith, the guardian of [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon_Vale.md), is the deity of the wild, revered by [Elsira Ravenshadow](../People/Elsira_Ravenshadow.md) and her eco-defenders. Chosen by [The_Lady](The_Lady.md) as the embodiment of life's unpredictability, Cresith holds dominion over the beasts that roam the woods, from the common to the mythical. Their worship is a testament to the reverence for the chaotic beauty of nature.
