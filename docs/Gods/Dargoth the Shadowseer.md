## Dargoth, the Shadowseer

Dargoth, the deity of fate and prophecy, is believed to have been the First author of the [Prophecies of the Narrative](Prophecies%20of%20the%20Narrative.md). Guided by the teachings of [Djinn](../People/Djinn.md), their visions entwine the world's myriad threads of destiny. With one eye always turned to the shifting future, Dargoth is revered by many sages, such as [Morganna_the_Seer](../People/Morganna_the_Seer.md) and [Liora the Seeker](../People/Liora_Seeker.md), who seek guidance within the boundless pages of the [Infinite Library](../Places/Infinite_Library.md). Bearing their mysterious sigil from the menhir portals of [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon_Vale.md), Dargoth serves as an eternal font of knowledge and wisdom, illuminating the winding path of fate.
