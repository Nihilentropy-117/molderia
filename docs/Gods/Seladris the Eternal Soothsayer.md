## Seladris, the Eternal Soothsayer

Seladris, the Eternal Soothsayer, governs the tidal ebb and flow of time and destiny, offering glimpses of past, present, and future through the mesmerizing alignment of the sunbeams within the [Solarium of Whispers](../Places/Solarium%20of%20Whispers.md). They watch over the [Sands of Futurity](../Places/Sands%20of%20Futurity.md), weaving threads of fate that connect unexpected moments to reveal the hidden workings of the [Infinite Library](../Places/Infinite%20Library.md). Their influence lies heavily upon the [Whispering Garden](../Places/Whispering%20Garden.md), the original sanctuary of [The Old Ones](../Lore/The%20Old%20Ones.md).
