## Seladris, the Eternal Soothsayer

Seladris, the Eternal Soothsayer, governs the tidal ebb and flow of time and destiny, offering glimpses of past, present, and future through the mesmerizing alignment of the sunbeams within the [Solarium_of_Whispers](../Places/Solarium_of_Whispers.md). They watch over the [Sands_of_Futurity](../Places/Sands_of_Futurity.md), weaving threads of fate that connect unexpected moments to reveal the hidden workings of the [Infinite Library](../Places/Infinite_Library.md). Their influence lies heavily upon the [Whispering_Garden](../Places/Whispering_Garden.md), the original sanctuary of [The Old Ones](The%20Old%20Ones.md).
