## Thalanar, the Shifting Tide

Thalanar is the deity of balance, born from the magical energies of the [Leyline Nexus](../Places/Leyline%20Nexus.md). They were bestowed with life by [Djinn](../People/Djinn.md). Thalanar governs over the elemental forces of water, with the [Crimson Falls](../Places/Crimson%20Falls.md) considered their sacred domain. As both a savior and a destroyer, they embody the ever-shifting, dual nature of water, cleansing and healing the world on one hand, while devastating it with powerful floods and storms on the other.
