## Thalanar, the Shifting Tide

Thalanar is the deity of balance, born from the magical energies of the Leyline Nexus. They were bestowed with life by Djinn. Thalanar governs over the elemental forces of water, with the Crimson Falls considered their sacred domain. As both a savior and a destroyer, they embody the ever-shifting, dual nature of water, cleansing and healing the world on one hand, while devastating it with powerful floods and storms on the other.
