## Dargoth, the Shadowseer

Dargoth, the deity of fate and prophecy, is believed to have been the First author of the Prophecies of the Narrative. Guided by the teachings of Djinn, their visions entwine the world's myriad threads of destiny. With one eye always turned to the shifting future, Dargoth is revered by many sages, such as Morganna the Seer and Liora, who seek guidance within the boundless pages of the Infinite Library. Bearing their mysterious sigil from the menhir portals of Darkmoon Vale, Dargoth serves as an eternal font of knowledge and wisdom, illuminating the winding path of fate.
