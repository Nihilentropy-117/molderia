## Deucenium Impact

The impact of the [Deucenium](Deucenium.md) meteor led to the dispersal of Deucenium dust across Molderia. This unique metal suppressed the natural magic derived from the [Azlanti Ioun Stones](../Artifacts/Azlanti%20Ioun%20Stones.md) given to the Azlanti and instead, infused the land and its inhabitants with its own magical energies. This event led to the rapid evolution of the Azlanti, Porto-Orcs, and Porto-Dwarves into their modern forms, introducing an era where every being was inherently capable of spellcasting.
