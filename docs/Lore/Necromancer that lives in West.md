The Necromancer in the Tower in the West is a position of great power and responsibility, a role passed down through the ages. The Necromancer is chosen by a supernatural entity and is bound to the Tower until they find a worthy successor. They are tasked with protecting the Tower and its secrets, as well as maintaining the balance of magic in the world.

The Necromancer is a formidable magic user, specializing in the manipulation of life and death. They are known to be able to commune with spirits, raise the dead, and even manipulate the flow of time. However, the Necromancer is also bound by a code of conduct, forbidden from using their powers for personal gain or to cause unnecessary harm.

The current Necromancer in the Tower is Jimoryn Faelan, a figure shrouded in mystery. Despite his power, he is also known for his wisdom and his willingness to aid those who seek his help, provided they respect the rules of the Tower.

As the Necromancer, Jimoryn has access to a wide range of powerful spells and abilities. He is a master of necromancy, capable of raising the dead, communing with spirits, and manipulating life energy. He is also known to have some control over time, able to slow it down or speed it up within the confines of the Tower.
