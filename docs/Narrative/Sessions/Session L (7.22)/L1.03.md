## Chapter 3: Confronting the Queen

The party made their way to the Pathfinder Society lodge, where they presented the amberhollow artifact to the scholars for study. The artifact held the undying essence of the long-lost King of Biting Ants, a powerful being whose wisdom and knowledge could potentially unlock new paths for the adventurers.

As they settled into the lodge, the party reflected on their journey through the Mogolo Expanse. They had faced formidable challenges, but they had emerged stronger and wiser. Stuinvolk, now free from the curse, considered working in a supporting capacity at the lodge level, using his knowledge and experience to aid future adventurers.
