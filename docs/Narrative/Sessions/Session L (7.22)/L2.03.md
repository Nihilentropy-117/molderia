## Chapter 6: Bork goes the Weasel

The party arrived in Bork, a small mountain city known for breeding exotic winged beasts. The town was nestled amidst the mountains, and its population of 11,200 was spread across 30 villages. 

As the adventurers explored the bustling markets, they were captivated by the sights and sounds that surrounded them. The air was filled with the scents of spices, freshly baked bread, and the occasional whiff of exotic creatures.

The locals were welcoming to the visitors, eager to share their knowledge and stories. They spoke of the Festival of Winged Beasts, a grand celebration that took place annually in Bork.

Amidst the vibrant market, Fen, the party's rogue, caught sight of an enigmatic merchant named Villalobos. Intrigued by his assortment of magical goods, Fen approached him. Villalobos, feigning philanthropy, offered Fen a deal: a significant discount on magical goods in exchange for a large amount of fur and personal excrement.

With the deal struck, Fen acquired the discounted magical goods from Villalobos, sourced from the gray market.
