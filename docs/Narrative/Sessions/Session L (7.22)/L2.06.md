## Chapter 9: A Sigh, A Sign, Asylum

In this eerie asylum, refugees clung desperately to survival, their weary faces haunted by horrors they had witnessed. The players encountered bizarre creatures to battle and, in the process, were temporarily tricked by fey mischief, losing their names and identities.

As the players stumbled through the fog, disoriented and confused, they found themselves standing before the imposing gates of the asylum. The heavy iron doors creaked open, revealing a dimly lit hallway that seemed to stretch on endlessly. With trepidation, they stepped inside, their senses heightened as they navigated the labyrinthine corridors.

It was then that they realized they had fallen victim to the tricks of the fey. Their names and identities were stripped away, leaving them feeling vulnerable and uncertain. 

"I must sing to be heard, yet I have no voice. What am I?" 
"Potatoes have skin, so do I. So, I am the potato. What am I?" 

With their names and identities restored, the players continued their exploration of the asylum. They encountered refugees huddled in corners, their eyes filled with fear and desperation. The survivors shared their stories of the horrors they had witnessed, tales of twisted experiments and malevolent spirits that haunted the asylum's halls.

Moved by their plight, the players vowed to protect the refugees and find a way to bring an end to the asylum's torment. They fought against bizarre creatures that lurked in the shadows, using their newfound strength and wit to overcome each challenge.
