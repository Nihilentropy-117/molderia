This tunnel, shrouded in darkness, revealed an astonishing sight - an immense bridge of bone stretching out before them, its structure crafted from the names of all who would ever visit the mythical city of the Djinn. The sorcerer's violin, trembling with energy, became attuned to plane shift in this very spot. With 1,759,800 planks, each separated by a one-foot gap, this colossal bridge spanned a staggering 1,000 miles across an almost unfathomable chasm located within the alternate plane of Earth. Markers lined the way, spaced 10 miles – or two hours – apart. Undaunted by this immense challenge, the players pressed on, traversing the seemingly endless bone bridge for almost two weeks. Such a harrowing journey would test the resolve of even the most seasoned adventurers, but the group never wavered in their determination. With every step, the lure of the fabled city of the Djinn beckoned them onwards.
