# Chapter 11: Journey Across the Bone Bridge

 As the party stepped onto the bone bridge, they were immediately struck by its grandeur and the weight of the countless names that adorned its structure. Each step echoed through the vast expanse, the sound reverberating in the silence. They marveled at the sheer size of the bridge, its planks stretching out as far as the eye could see.

Days turned into nights, and nights turned into days as the party pressed on, their resolve unyielding. As they reached each marker, spaced 10 miles apart, the party took a moment to rest and regroup. 

Finally, after almost two weeks of arduous travel, the party arrived at the end of the bone bridge. They then were tricked into entering the In of The Calif, where they encountered the demon Neerok, and eventually escaped. 


With a mixture of excitement and trepidation, the party stepped into the Djinn city, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. The party sought out the powerful Djinn, hoping to gain their permission to enter further into the city.
