At the heart of the city, the King of the Dwarves himself offered the players an intriguing side quest: to assassinate the notorious Baron Karstark, a figure who cast a dark shadow over the region. Intrepid as ever, the team made their preparations and embarked on a strategic mission to infiltrate the opulent mansion of the Baron.

Under the cover of darkness, the players approached the mansion, their steps muffled by the soft soil. They had gathered valuable information about the layout of the mansion, the guards' patrol patterns, and any potential weaknesses in the Baron's security. With this knowledge in mind, they devised a plan to slip past the guards unnoticed and reach the heart of the mansion.
