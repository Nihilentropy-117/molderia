## Chapter 26

As the players made their way back to the bustling dwarven city, they were greeted by the familiar sights and sounds of Goth'ar'giglas. Upon their arrival, the players were ushered into the throne room to receive their reward from the dwarf king. Seated on his regal stone throne, adorned with shining gemstones and intricate carvings, the dwarf king greeted them with a nod of approval. He commended them for their successful mission and presented them with several large crates piled high in a dimly lit storeroom.

Curiosity piqued, the players eagerly rummaged through the crates, uncovering an eclectic mix of items. Among the assortment were finely crafted pieces of furniture, horse-drawn carriages, and suits of armor. Interspersed with these treasures were age-old wheels of cheese and bottles of wine, remnants of forgotten feasts. 

Emboldened by their newfound wealth, the players decided to organize a caravan to traverse the vast expanse of the Grand Desert. They hired skilled guides and procured supplies, ensuring they were well-prepared for the arduous journey ahead. With their caravan assembled, they set forth on a dusty, sun-baked path towards the city of Morath-dor, the capital of the goblin financial empire.

Days turned into weeks as the players traversed the harsh and unforgiving landscape of the Grand Desert. The scorching sun beat down upon them, and the shifting sands seemed to stretch on endlessly. They faced treacherous sandstorms and encountered dangerous desert creatures, relying on their skills and teamwork to overcome each obstacle.
