# Chapter 32: Journey to Morath Dor

The scorching sun beat down upon the party as they continued their arduous journey across the vast desert. The heat was relentless, and their water supplies dwindled with each passing day. They pressed on, their determination unwavering, as they knew that their destination, the city of Morath'dor, awaited them.

As they traveled, the party encountered various challenges posed by the harsh desert environment. Sandstorms whipped through the dunes, threatening to engulf them in a swirling vortex of sand and wind. They sought shelter in the lee of rocky outcroppings, waiting for the storms to pass before continuing their trek.

In the distance, they spotted a roving band of orc mercenaries and thieves. The orcs, their rough and weathered faces hidden beneath tattered cloths, eyed the party with suspicion. But the adventurers, armed with proof of their travel insurance, were able to avoid conflict. They showed the orcs their documentation, proving that they were authorized travelers, and were allowed to pass without incident.

As they entered Morath'dor, the party found themselves immersed in a vibrant and bustling metropolis. The streets were alive with the sounds of merchants hawking their wares, the aroma of exotic spices wafting through the air. The adventurers marveled at the various markets, each offering a unique array of goods and services.

In the central market square, Turkus, ever the gambler, couldn't resist the opportunity to place a bet on an upcoming football match. He confidently wagered 1000 gold on Earth Team winning, convinced of their superior skills. The bookmaker, a wily goblin, eagerly accepted the bet, his eyes gleaming with the promise of profit.


Driven by their quest for the final artifact, the party made their way to the opulent palace of the trade prince. The palace stood as a testament to the wealth and influence of the goblin elite, its halls adorned with fine silks and glittering jewels. They were granted an audience with the trade prince, a cunning goblin whose every word dripped with calculated charm.

In the opulent chamber, the trade prince revealed that he possessed knowledge of the final artifact's location. He spoke of a deserted island nestled within the azure embrace of the inland sea, a place where the artifact lay hidden. The trade prince offered his assistance in securing passage on a vessel that would take them to the island, but his aid came at a price. He requested a favor to be fulfilled at a later date, a debt that the party would owe him.

With their preparations complete, the party bid farewell to the bustling city of Morath'dor.
