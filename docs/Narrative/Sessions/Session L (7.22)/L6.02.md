# Chapter 33: Arrival on the Island

Wasting not a minute, our heroes made haste. Before departing, they were sure to first secure their newfound riches by opening bank accounts with the goblin financiers. With their treasures safe and their eyes gleaming with adventure, the boats sliced through the sea's tranquil surface, its waves eagerly carrying them to their ultimate destination.

Upon arriving on the mysterious island, the players discovered that the first colony of villagers were missing -- kidnapped by the insidious cultists of Hastur who had infiltrated half of their ranks. The players felt a surge of determination and urgency, knowing that they had to rescue the villagers and put an end to the cultists' nefarious plans.

Venturing deep into the dense jungle, the players followed rumors of a hidden temple where the cultists were rumored to be hiding. The jungle was alive with the sounds of exotic creatures and the rustling of leaves, adding an air of mystery and danger to their journey.

Finally, the players stumbled upon the hidden temple. Its ancient stone walls were covered in moss and vines, a testament to the passage of time. They cautiously entered the temple, their senses heightened and their weapons at the ready.

Inside, they were met with an eerie silence, broken only by the faint sound of dripping water. The air was heavy with a sense of foreboding, as if the very walls held the weight of the truth they sought. They carefully explored the temple, searching for any signs of the missing villagers and the cultists.

Their search led them deeper into the temple, where they encountered the Spawn of Hastur, a monstrous creature created by the cultists to stop anyone from reaching the inner sanctum. The Spawn stood before them, a towering fusion of twisted plant matter and decaying flesh, its sharp bony claws ready to strike.

After a grueling fight, the players emerged victorious, the Spawn of Hastur lying defeated at their feet. They took a moment to catch their breath, their bodies covered in sweat and dirt. But there was no time to rest, as they knew that the fate of the missing villagers and the success of their mission still hung in the balance.
