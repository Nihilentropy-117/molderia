## Chapter 34: The Island

As the players ventured deeper into the dense jungle, they followed the eerie atmosphere and strange markings along the path. The air was thick with humidity, and the sounds of exotic creatures filled the air. The players felt a sense of unease as they continued their journey, their senses heightened and their weapons at the ready.

Suddenly, they came upon a clearing where a tribe of sentient monkeys resided. The monkeys chattered excitedly as the players approached, their eyes filled with curiosity and intelligence. The players cautiously approached the monkeys, unsure of how they would be received.

The leader of the monkey tribe, a wise and elderly monkey named Koko, stepped forward. 

Through their interactions, the players learned that the monkeys had been observing the activities of the cultists on the island. They shared valuable information about the cultists' whereabouts and their plans to sacrifice the missing villagers in a dark ritual. The monkeys offered their assistance in navigating the treacherous terrain and provided the players with a map that detailed the location of the cultists' hideout.
