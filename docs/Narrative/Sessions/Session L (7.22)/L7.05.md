## The Dragon and The Demon

The players encounter a Dragon, and are horribly defeated, with the Paladin dying and being trapped by Sori in a Soul gem. They manage to escape via a random dimension jump, and end up in Hell. 

The players strike a deal with a Demon Prince named YrkYrkHrk, who promises to resurrect their fallen comrade Turkus in exchange for helping him retrieve the Anal Beads of Angor, which were lost during a fierce battle against a dragon three years prior. The Demon Prince reveals that a monk, who was tasked with finding the beads, has not fulfilled his end of the bargain. Now, the players must track down the missing monk and uncover the location of the lost beads.
