The players head to the north in order to find the missing beads of Angor. They cross across the northern reach of the great desert and encounter a sandwyrm. After a hard battle, they manage to kill it, but another appears soon after. The new wyrm takes them to the enclave of Ja'To, where they barter water for passage. They are allowed to enter the Ja'To LeyGate, and traverse the Paths to get to Fizbans Folly. They make it most of the way without incident, but as they approach the exit, they are accosted by MachinShin, and his army. They manage to burn their way through with positive energy, and make it through the Tharkas LeyGate, locking it behind them.
