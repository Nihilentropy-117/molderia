**The Ethereal Echo**, a realm with striking similarities to the fey realms of fantasy, now exists adjacent to Molderia. Populated by the Ethersprites, these beings have mastered the art of illusion and can conjure objects seemingly from thin air. Their society, however, sees iron as a rare and precious commodity, capable of grounding and dispelling magic. Hidden gateways in the wildernesses of Molderia serve as conduits between these two realities, enabling travel and interaction.
