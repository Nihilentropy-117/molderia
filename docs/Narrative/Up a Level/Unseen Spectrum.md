**The Unseen Spectrum** is another reality, only reachable through the ingestion of Dreamdust, a rare substance refined by the Ethersprites. This realm embodies the pure consciousness, populated by cosmic entities known as Spectrum Stewards, capable of bending space and time, creating from nothingness, and seemingly reading thoughts of others. The journey to this realm often comes with feelings of confusion and awe, akin to the experience described by many Earth-dwellers as alien abduction.
