This intricately carved staff is adorned with shimmering green emeralds. When empowered with a Nethrael Stone, it grants the wielder the ability to channel the raw energy of nature. The staff becomes a conduit for powerful druidic magic, allowing the player to cast spells from the druid spell list. Additionally, the staff can summon a loyal animal companion to aid the wielder in battle.
