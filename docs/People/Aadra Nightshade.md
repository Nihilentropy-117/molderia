## Aadra Nightshade

Aadra Nightshade, a tiefling bard, manipulates powerful figures from the shadows, influencing both [Renna the Runesmith](Renna%20the%20Runesmith.md) and [Brother Torsten](Brother%20Torsten.md) in their pursuits. Concocting her own plans inspired by the legends of the [Shattered Gate](../Places/Shattered%20Gate.md)and the [Monarchs Seat](../Places/Monarchs%20Seat.md), Aadra hopes to reclaim her forgotten [Azlanti](../Lore/Azlanti.md) heritage.
