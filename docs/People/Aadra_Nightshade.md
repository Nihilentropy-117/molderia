## Aadra Nightshade

[Aadra Nightshade](.md), a tiefling bard, manipulates powerful figures from the shadows, influencing both [Renna the Runesmith](../People/Renna_Runesmith.md) and [Brother Torsten](Brother_Torsten.md) in their pursuits. Concocting her own plans inspired by the legends of the [Shattered_Gate](../Places/Shattered_Gate.md)and the [Monarchs_Seat](../Places/Monarchs_Seat.md), Aadra hopes to reclaim her forgotten [Azlanti](../Lore/Azlanti.md) heritage.
