## Andromeda Nightshard

Andromeda, a human cleric who once served [Thalloren the Whispering Wind](../Gods/Thalloren%20the%20Whispering%20Wind.md), now offers her healing skills. Appalled by the atrocities committed in the name of [DAliz](DAliz.md), she renounced her homeland of [Sylvania](../Places/Sylvania.md), hoping to grant solace and guidance to those seeking sanctuary. While providing support for Andromeda, Thal'loren speaks to her through rose petals that rain down from the [Whispering Garden](../Places/Whispering%20Garden.md), offering cryptic clues to [Cresith the Wildheart](../Gods/Cresith%20the%20Wildheart.md)'s location.
