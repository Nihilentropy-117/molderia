## Andromeda Nightshard

Andromeda, a human cleric who once served Thalloren the Whispering Wind, now offers her healing skills. Appalled by the atrocities committed in the name of DAliz, she renounced her homeland of Sylvania, hoping to grant solace and guidance to those seeking sanctuary. While providing support for Andromeda, Thal'loren speaks to her through rose petals that rain down from the Whispering Garden, offering cryptic clues to Cresith the Wildheart's location.
