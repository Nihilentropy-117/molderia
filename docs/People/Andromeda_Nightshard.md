## Andromeda Nightshard

Andromeda, a human cleric who once served [Thalloren_the_Whispering_Wind](../Gods/Thalloren_the_Whispering_Wind.md), now offers her healing skills. Appalled by the atrocities committed in the name of [DAliz](DAliz.md), she renounced her homeland of [Sylvania](../Places/Sylvania.md), hoping to grant solace and guidance to those seeking sanctuary. While providing support for Andromeda, Thal'loren speaks to her through rose petals that rain down from the [Whispering_Garden](../Places/Whispering_Garden.md), offering cryptic clues to [Cresith_the_Wildheart](../Gods/Cresith_the_Wildheart.md)'s location.
