## Artorius Blackvein

Artorius Blackvein is a human sorcerer studying the hidden chronicles within the [Shattered Library of Sudi](../Places/Shattered%20Library%20of%20Sudi.md), seeking magical prowess to fuel his vengeance against the spectral [Pirate Wilp](Pirate%20Wilp.md), who murdered his family. As a reluctant ally of [Gavric Ironmaw](Gavric%20Ironmaw.md), Artorius secretly covets the power [Villalobos](Villalobos.md) wields in his grotesque experiments. Amongst the foggy streets of [Sylvania](../Places/Sylvania.md), he hones his eldritch skills in the [Ghouls Gambit](../Places/Ghouls%20Gambit.md) casino, constantly gambling with fate.
