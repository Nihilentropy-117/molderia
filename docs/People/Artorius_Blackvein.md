Artorius Blackvein is a human sorcerer studying the hidden chronicles within the [Shattered_Library_of_Sudi](../Places/Shattered_Library_of_Sudi.md), seeking magical prowess to fuel his vengeance against the spectral [Pirate Wilp](Pirate_Wilp.md), who murdered his family. As a reluctant ally of [Gavric Ironmaw](Gavric_Ironmaw.md), Artorius secretly covets the power [Villalobos](Villalobos.md) wields in his grotesque experiments.
