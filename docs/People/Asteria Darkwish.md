## Asteria Darkwish

A cunning human rogue-turned-arcane trickster, Asteria spent her early years pilfering trinkets from the stalls of the Serpents Eye Oasis. Her affinity for sleight of hand eventually led her to discover the ethereal song that unlocks the Shattered Gate, releasing magical anomalies from within. Now, haunted by the consequences of her actions and bearing intricate tattoos imbued with the Song's power, Asteria seeks redemption by assisting the eco-defenders of Darkmoon Vale.
