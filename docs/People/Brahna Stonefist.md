## Brahna Stonefist

Descended from a long line of architects from Targallene, Brahna has faced ridicule and disbelief from her peers as she reveals visions of a lost civilization buried deep beneath the city. Her unshakable faith in these visions, which she believes are granted by The Lady, brings Brahna to the ancient Jorgenvault. As she unearths forgotten mysteries, Brahna embarks on a journey to solve the riddle of her own bloodline.
