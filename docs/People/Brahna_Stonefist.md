## Brahna Stonefist

Descended from a long line of architects from [Targallene](../Places/Targallene.md), Brahna has faced ridicule and disbelief from her peers as she reveals visions of a lost civilization buried deep beneath the city. Her unshakable faith in these visions, which she believes are granted by [The Lady](../Gods/The%20Lady.md), brings Brahna to the ancient [Jorgenvault](../Places/Jorgenvault.md). As she unearths forgotten mysteries, Brahna embarks on a journey to solve the riddle of her own bloodline.
