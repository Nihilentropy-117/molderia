## Dalgor Ironsight

Dalgor Ironsight is a mighty orc cleric who found redemption after a fateful encounter with [Liora](Liora.md) in the Ashen Monastery. Touched by the divine encounter, Dalgor dedicated himself to spreading the light of the Great Wheel, fighting against the uprising evil consuming [Gothargiglas](../Places/Gothargiglas.md). Armed with newfound wisdom from [Kaelen Strongbrew](Kaelen%20Strongbrew.md), Dalgor seeks to bring unity among the orc tribes within the mountains of [Bork](../Places/Bork.md), and rally them against the encroaching darkness emanating from the Shattered Tower.
