## Eamon Shatterstone

Eamon is a courageous half-elf paladin who once served under Baron Lucious D'Nite but was disillusioned by the corruption he witnessed. Turning to [Thalanar the Shifting Tide](Thalanar%20the%20Shifting%20Tide.md), for guidance, Eamon formed a group of like-minded warriors dedicated to upholding the balance Thalanar represents. He now leads them to bring justice to the world by toppling corrupt rulers, starting in the tumultuous realm of [Gothargiglas](../Places/Gothargiglas.md).
