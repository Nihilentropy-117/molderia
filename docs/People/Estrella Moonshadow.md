## Estrella Moonshadow

Estrella Moonshadow, a mysterious tabaxi bard, discovered a hidden Nethraelprophecy in the Crystal Caverns, which she now aims to unravel. Guided by the melodies from the Shattered Gate, Estrella uncovered an ancient song that could shake the very foundations of the world. As she performs across the realm, invoking the spirits that slumber in the Jorgenvault, Estrella finds herself increasingly pursued by the secretive Sylarus the Tombraider.
