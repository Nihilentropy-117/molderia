## Estrella Moonshadow

Estrella Moonshadow, a mysterious tabaxi bard, discovered a hidden [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md)prophecy in the [Crystal Caverns](../Places/Crystal%20Caverns.md), which she now aims to unravel. Guided by the melodies from the [Shattered Gate](../Places/Shattered%20Gate.md), Estrella uncovered an ancient song that could shake the very foundations of the world. As she performs across the realm, invoking the spirits that slumber in the [Jorgenvault](../Places/Jorgenvault.md), Estrella finds herself increasingly pursued by the secretive [Sylarus the Tombraider](Sylarus%20the%20Tombraider.md).
