## Estrella Moonshadow

Estrella Moonshadow, a mysterious tabaxi bard, discovered a hidden [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md)prophecy in the [Crystal_Caverns](../Places/Crystal_Caverns.md), which she now aims to unravel. Guided by the melodies from the [Shattered_Gate](../Places/Shattered_Gate.md), Estrella uncovered an ancient song that could shake the very foundations of the world. As she performs across the realm, invoking the spirits that slumber in the [Jorgenvault](../Places/Jorgenvault.md), Estrella finds herself increasingly pursued by the secretive [Sylarus_the_Tombraider](Sylarus_the_Tombraider.md).
