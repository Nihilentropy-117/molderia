## Faelor Nightshade

Faelor Nightshade is a tabaxi bard who uncovered a mystical lyre within the Ethereal Bazaar, allowing him to masterfully play the time-worn melody to open the Shattered Gate. Hailing from Darkmoon Vale, Faelor's thirst for adventure and newfound musical powers led him to seek out the secretive order of knights residing in the Lunarspire Citadel. Deeply inspired by the enchanting tales of Thalloren the Whispering Wind, Faelor travels the realm, using his extraordinary abilities to soothe troubled souls.
