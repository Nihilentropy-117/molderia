## Faelor Nightshade

Faelor Nightshade is a tabaxi bard who uncovered a mystical lyre within the [Ethereal Bazaar](../Places/Ethereal%20Bazaar.md), allowing him to masterfully play the time-worn melody to open the Shattered Gate. Hailing from [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon%20Vale.md), Faelor's thirst for adventure and newfound musical powers led him to seek out the secretive order of knights residing in the [Lunarspire Citadel](../Places/Lunarspire%20Citadel.md). Deeply inspired by the enchanting tales of [Thalloren the Whispering Wind](../Gods/Thalloren%20the%20Whispering%20Wind.md), Faelor travels the realm, using his extraordinary abilities to soothe troubled souls.
