## Faelora Starseeker

Faelora, a nomadic high elf sorceress, specializes in weaving ancient Nethrael magics to unravel the threads of history and uncover the tales of lesser-known civilizations. Her thirst for knowledge led her to the Infinite Library in search of the encrypted documents detailing the Prophecies of the Narrative. As she deciphers the eldritch texts, Faelora inadvertently draws the attention of the nefarious Yorick Bladewraith, placing her squarely in the crosshairs of a dangerous race against time.
