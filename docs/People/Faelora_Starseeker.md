## Faelora Starseeker

Faelora, a nomadic high elf sorceress, specializes in weaving ancient [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md) magics to unravel the threads of history and uncover the tales of lesser-known civilizations. Her thirst for knowledge led her to the [Infinite Library](../Places/Infinite_Library.md) in search of the encrypted documents detailing the [Prophecies_of_Narrative](../Artifacts/Prophecies_of_Narrative.md). As she deciphers the eldritch texts, Faelora inadvertently draws the attention of the nefarious [Yorick Bladewraith](../People/Yorick_Bladewraith.md), placing her squarely in the crosshairs of a dangerous race against time.
