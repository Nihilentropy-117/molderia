## Faelwyn Brightspire

Faelwyn Brightspire is a tiefling sorcerer trained in elemental magic and a key member of the [Veils Edge](../Places/Veils%20Edge.md) monastery. Born to noble parents residing in [HIELCIOFNONA](../Places/HIELCIOFNONA.md), Faelwyn was ostracized due to her infernal heritage but found solace under the guidance of Torstin the Thunderhewn, a dwarf cleric of the Order of Balance. Seeking the ethereal wisdom of the spirits inhabiting the [Phantoms Rest](../Places/Phantoms Rest.md), Faelwyn gained mastery over the arcane runes within the [Nethrael](Nethrael.md) circles.
