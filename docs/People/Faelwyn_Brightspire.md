## Faelwyn Brightspire

Faelwyn Brightspire is a tiefling sorcerer trained in elemental magic and a key member of the [Veils_Edge](../Places/Veils_Edge.md) monastery. Born to noble parents residing in [HIELCIOFNONA](../Places/HIELCIOFNONA.md), Faelwyn was ostracized due to her infernal heritage but found solace under the guidance of Torstin the Thunderhewn, a dwarf cleric of the Order of Balance. Seeking the ethereal wisdom of the spirits inhabiting the [Phantoms_Rest](../Places/Phantoms_Rest.md), Faelwyn gained mastery over the arcane runes within the [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md) circles.
