## Grelda Ironbough

Grelda Ironbough is a tough, stalwart dwarf druid who discovered the enchanted flora of [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon%20Vale.md) after fleeing the destruction of her homeland and the [Dwarven Councils](Dwarven%20Councils.md). Encountering the half-elf villagers living within the Vale, Grelda formed an unlikely bond with the reclusive community and vowed to protect the ancient magic and the serenity of their shared home. Grelda now leads a group of eco-defenders against intruders who seek to exploit the mystical energies of the Vale's menhir portals.
