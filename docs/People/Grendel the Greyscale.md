## Grendel the Greyscale

A dragonborn cleric of [The Lady](../Gods/The%20Lady.md), Grendel traverses the [Bummehilldes](../Places/Bummehilldes.md) as a wandering healer, an emissary of hope to the desperate and the destitute. His kind heart is tempered by a deep rage, haunted by memories of his former life in servitude to the evil Thuldrin Kreed in [Falcons Hollow](../Places/Falcons%20Hollow.md).
