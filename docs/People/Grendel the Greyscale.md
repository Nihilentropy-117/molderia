## Grendel the Greyscale

A dragonborn cleric of The Lady, Grendel traverses the Bummehilldes as a wandering healer, an emissary of hope to the desperate and the destitute. His kind heart is tempered by a deep rage, haunted by memories of his former life in servitude to the evil Thuldrin Kreed in Falcons Hollow.
