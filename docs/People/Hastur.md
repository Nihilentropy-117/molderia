## Hastur

Hastur, King in Yellow, is powerful entity from otherworldly realm known as Carcosa. According to legend, he was once human ruler of ancient city of Alar, but his lust for power and knowledge led him to make pact with the Great Old Ones, granting him immense power but at cost of his sanity and his humanity. He is now a godlike being, worshipped by cults and feared by those who know of his existence.
