## Ignatius the Wanderer

Ignatius is a stoic and taciturn Goliath druid who has taken it upon himself to protect the harsh and unforgiving [Bummehilldes](../Places/Bummehilldes.md) desert. Meditating within the [Lake Tseepoo](../Places/Lake_Tseepoo.md) region, he has attained an intimate understanding of the desert's unique balance of life and death, using it to ensure survival for both its inhabitants and weary travelers. His unfathomable connection to the ancient power grants him the ability to manipulate the sands to his will, a force few have ever witnessed.
