## Irsela Shadowdance

Irsela Shadowdance, a halfling bard from [Djinn](../People/Djinn.md) City, stumbled upon an ancient [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md) spell tome within the depths of the Shattered Gate. Seeking to understand its cryptic messages, she turns to [Renna the Runesmith](../People/Renna_Runesmith.md) for aid, only to inadvertently summon otherworldly creatures in the process.
