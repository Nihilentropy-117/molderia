SPECIAL ABILITIES
=================================================
**Amiable Blunder** Once per day when you fail a Diplomacy check by 5 or more and would cause an NPC's attitude toward you to worsen, you can immediately attempt another Diplomacy check against the same DC as a free action. If you succeed at this second Diplomacy check, the character's attitude doesn't change, as though you had failed the original check by 4 or less.

**Bard Spell Level 5 (5x)** 

**Bone Mysteries** You draw upon the divine mystery of Bone to grant your spells and powers.

**Bonus Bardic Performance Round (5x)** Add 1 to the bard's total number of bardic performance rounds per day.

**Bonus Bard Spell (5x)** Add one spell known from the bard spell list. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level the bard can cast.

**Death's Touch (Su)** You can cause terrible wounds to appear on a creature with a melee touch attack. This attack deals 1d6+2 points of negative energy damage. If used against an undead creature, it heals damage and grants a +2 channel resistance for 1 minute. You can use this ability a 10 times per day.

**Drow Blooded** Some half-elves born of drow parents exhibit more drow traits than others:particularly many of the physical features of the drow:and have darkvision 60 feet and light blindness.

**Drow-Descended** These half-elves clearly bear the features of their dark elf parents, branding them immediately as a potential threat in the eyes of others no matter what their intent or character. These half-elves have the drow-blooded and drow magic alternate racial traits.

**Drow Magic** A few half-elves with drow ancestry exhibit the innate magic of that race. Half-elves with this trait have drow blood somewhere in their background, and can cast dancing lights, darkness, and faerie fire each once per day, using the half-elf's character level as the caster level for these spell-like abilities. This racial trait replaces the adaptability and multi-talented racial traits.

**Elf Blood (Ex)** Half-elves count as both elves and humans for any effect related to race.

**Elven Immunities (Ex)** Half-elves are immune to magic sleep effects and get a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells and effects.

**Haunted** Malevolent spirits follow you wherever you go, causing minor mishaps and strange occurrences (such as unexpected breezes, small objects moving on their own, and faint noises).

**Keen Senses (Ex)** Half-elves receive a +2 bonus on Perception skill checks.

**Language** Half-elves begin play speaking Common and Elven. Half-elves with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic).

**Light Blindness (Ex)** You are blinded for 1 round if exposed to bright light, such as sunlight or the daylight spell. You are dazzled as long as you remain in areas of bright light.

**Low-Light Vision (Ex)** You can see x2 as far as humans in low illumination. Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-Light Vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light. Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.

**Orisons** You can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they are not expended when used and may be used again.

**Skill unlock perform 5 Ranks** Whenever you attempt a Bluff, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, or Intimidate check, you can attempt a DC 20 Perform check to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.

**Unspeakable Bond (Elder God)** You are an ally of the unclean creatures of the world, and gain a +2 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks when dealing with creatures of the aberration type.

**Voice of the Grave (Su)** You can speak with dead, as per the spell, 5 rounds per day. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
