## Kaelius Stormbringer

Kaelius Stormbringer is a tempestuous sorcerer who survived the sinking of the Shattered Colonies due to a chance encounter with the legendary [Jeepit the Time-Bound](Jeepit%20the%20Time-Bound.md). Wielding the secret knowledge gleaned from the [Azlanti Ruins](../Places/Azlanti%20Ruins.md), Kaelius channels the raw power of [Thalanar the Shifting Tide](../Gods/Thalanar%20the%20Shifting%20Tide.md), unleashing torrents of water and devastating storms to protect the remnants of his people. Yet, his true calling lies in unearthing the cryptic warnings hidden within the [Shattered Colonies](../Places/Shattered%20Colonies.md)' ancient artifacts.
