## Lirielle Feybinder

Raised within [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon%20Vale.md) by half-elf villagers, Lirielle has developed a deep connection with ancient fey magic. Seeking to maintain harmony in her home, she bands together with the mysterious [Kalinda the Bard](Kalinda%20the%20Bard.md) to stop an influx of creatures from another plane, unleashed by the [Secret Barrow of Souls](../Places/Secret%20Barrow%20of%20Souls.md). Lirielle's quest leads her to explore the dangerous [Nethrael](Nethrael.md) menhirs scattered throughout [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon%20Vale.md).
