## Lirielle Feybinder

Raised within [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon_Vale.md) by half-elf villagers, Lirielle has developed a deep connection with ancient fey magic. Seeking to maintain harmony in her home, she bands together with the mysterious [Kalinda_the_Bard](Kalinda_the_Bard.md) to stop an influx of creatures from another plane, unleashed by the [Secret_Barrow_of_Souls](../Places/Secret_Barrow_of_Souls.md). Lirielle's quest leads her to explore the dangerous [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md) menhirs scattered throughout [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon_Vale.md).
