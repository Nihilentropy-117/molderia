## Lyra Everflame

[Lyra Everflame](.md), a skilled pyromancer from the outskirts of [HIELCIOFNONA](../Places/HIELCIOFNONA.md), is known for her impressive mastery of fire magic. After accidentally awakening a dormant [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md) artifact in the [Shattered_Colonies](../Places/Shattered_Colonies.md), her control over her abilities began to falter, prompting her to depart her homeland in search of guidance from the whispers of [Thalloren the Whispering Wind](../Gods/Thalloren%20the%20Whispering%20Wind.md).
