## Mara Dawnseeker

Mara Dawnseeker is a skilled ranger who once served within the ranks of the [Dwarven Councils](Dwarven%20Councils.md) but was banished due to a disagreement with [DAliz](DAliz.md), the Queen of the Underworld. Seeking redemption and driven by vengeance, Mara now roams the vast expanse of the [Sylvania](../Places/Sylvania.md) region, hunting down undead creatures and destroying them with deadly efficiency.
