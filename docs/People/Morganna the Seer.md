## Morganna the Seer

Morganna, a mysterious sorceress, was granted a vision of her future by Djinn within Djinn City, only to be cast out when she questioned his wisdom. She now roams the realm, seeking guidance from the endless shelves of the Infinite Library and yearning to uncover the truth behind her own ominous destiny.
