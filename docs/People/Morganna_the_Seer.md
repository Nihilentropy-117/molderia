## Morganna the Seer

Morganna, a mysterious sorceress, was granted a vision of her future by [Djinn](../People/Djinn.md) within Djinn City, only to be cast out when she questioned his wisdom. She now roams the realm, seeking guidance from the endless shelves of the [Infinite Library](../Places/Infinite_Library.md) and yearning to uncover the truth behind her own ominous destiny.
