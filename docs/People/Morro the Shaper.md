## Morro the Shaper

Born and raised in [Bork](../Places/Bork.md), Morro is a prodigy runesmith who secretly stole a page of a prophecy from the [Prophecies of the Narrative](../Artifacts/Prophecies%20of%20the%20Narrative.md). With his newfound knowledge, he sought mastery of the magical portals found within the [Nethrael](Nethrael.md) circles of [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon%20Vale.md), gambling his very existence on [The Lady](../Gods/The%20Lady.md)'s whimsical favor.
