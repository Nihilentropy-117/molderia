## Nariel Moonsong

A lithe wood elf ranger who spends her days exploring the hidden wonders of the [Infinite Library](../Places/Infinite%20Library.md). Guided by an enchanted compass created by [Villalobos](Villalobos.md), Nariel seeks knowledge and the remnants of the fabled [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md) concerning a prophetic event that could affect [HIELCIOFNONA](../Places/HIELCIOFNONA.md)'s future, all while evading capture from the Lady whose attention she had inadvertently drawn.
