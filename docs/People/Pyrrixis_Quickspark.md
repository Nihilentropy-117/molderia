## Pyrrixis Quickspark

A charismatic gnome artificer whose prized invention, a technical marvel based on the designs from the mad hatter [Datta](Datta.md), earned her the ire of Baron Lucious D'Nite. As she flees from those who would harm her, Pyrrixis avoids capture by visiting regions beyond their reach, using her charming wit and confidence to forge new alliances.
