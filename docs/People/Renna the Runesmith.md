## Renna the Runesmith

Born in [Gothargiglas](../Places/Gothargiglas.md), Renna discovered an ancient [Nethrael](Nethrael.md) spell tome and dedicated her life to studying the arcane arts once practiced by the mithral elves. Establishing her sanctum in the [Ruins of Sudi](../Places/Ruins%20of%20Sudi.md), she is sought out for her vast knowledge of runes and their relation to the menhir portals throughout [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon%20Vale.md).
