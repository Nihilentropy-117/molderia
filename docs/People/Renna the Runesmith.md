## Renna the Runesmith

Born in Gothargiglas, Renna discovered an ancient Nethrael spell tome and dedicated her life to studying the arcane arts once practiced by the mithral elves. Establishing her sanctum in the Ruins of Sudi, she is sought out for her vast knowledge of runes and their relation to the menhir portals throughout Darkmoon Vale.
