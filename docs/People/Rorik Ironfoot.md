## Rorik Ironfoot

Once an expert mechano-forger in the workshops of [Gothargiglas](../Places/Gothargiglas.md), Rorik Ironfoot had a chance encounter with a [Rift Key](../Artifacts/Rift%20Key.md) in the [Gloomcavern Nexus](../Places/Gloomcavern%20Nexus.md) that caused him to be displaced in time. Unable to fully control these newfound powers, Rorik inadvertently blinks through history, while trying to discover the secrets of the [Clockwork Labyrinth](../Places/Clockwork%20Labyrinth.md) to return to his own time.
