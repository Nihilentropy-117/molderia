## Rorik Ironfoot

Once an expert mechano-forger in the workshops of [Gothargiglas](../Places/Gothargiglas.md), [Rorik Ironfoot](../People/Rorik_Ironfoot.md) had a chance encounter with a [Rift Key](Rift%20Key.md) in the [Gloomcavern Nexus](../Places/Gloomcavern_Nexus.md) that caused him to be displaced in time. Unable to fully control these newfound powers, Rorik inadvertently blinks through history, while trying to discover the secrets of the [Clockwork_Labyrinth](../Places/Clockwork_Labyrinth.md) to return to his own time.
