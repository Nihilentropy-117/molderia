## Seraphina Stormwielder

Seraphina, a changeling sorceress, chanced upon a fragment of [Ilianna Stormbringer](Ilianna%20Stormbringer.md)'s essence during her travels, and, in doing so, acquired the prowess to control storm magic. Her latest quest has led her to the [Whispering Garden](../Places/Whispering%20Garden.md), deciphering crucial links between the [Nethrael](Nethrael.md) standing stones and the ancient empire's relics rumored to be scattered across the [Shattered Colonies](../Places/Shattered%20Colonies.md). Seraphina's ever-changing identity and mastery over the elements have made her a valuable, albeit unpredictable, ally to [Elira Windrider](Elira%20Windrider.md) and her gryphon companion, Stormwing. But her alignment with [The Lady](../Gods/The%20Lady.md)'s purpose remains uncertain, rendering her true intentions inscrutable.
