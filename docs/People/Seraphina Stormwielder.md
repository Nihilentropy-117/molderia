## Seraphina Stormwielder

Seraphina, a changeling sorceress, chanced upon a fragment of Ilianna Stormbringer's essence during her travels, and, in doing so, acquired the prowess to control storm magic. Her latest quest has led her to the Whispering Garden, deciphering crucial links between the Nethrael standing stones and the ancient empire's relics rumored to be scattered across the Shattered Colonies. Seraphina's ever-changing identity and mastery over the elements have made her a valuable, albeit unpredictable, ally to Elira Windrider and her gryphon companion, Stormwing. But her alignment with The Lady's purpose remains uncertain, rendering her true intentions inscrutable.
