## Seraphine Windwalker

Seraphine Windwalker, a fierce elf rogue, once unearthed a valuable artifact in the Leyline Nexus that granted her mastery over the wind elements. However, the power awakened a restless Nethrael spirit that now seeks to reclaim its ancient possession. Seraphine found refuge among the non-violent vampires of Sylvania and now devotes her life to finding a way to free herself from this relentless apparition.
