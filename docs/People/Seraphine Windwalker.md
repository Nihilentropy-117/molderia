## Seraphine Windwalker

Seraphine Windwalker, a fierce elf rogue, once unearthed a valuable artifact in the [Leyline Nexus](../Places/Leyline%20Nexus.md) that granted her mastery over the wind elements. However, the power awakened a restless [Nethrael](Nethrael.md) spirit that now seeks to reclaim its ancient possession. Seraphine found refuge among the non-violent vampires of [Sylvania](../Places/Sylvania.md) and now devotes her life to finding a way to free herself from this relentless apparition.
