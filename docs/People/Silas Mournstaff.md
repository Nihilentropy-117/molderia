## Silas Mournstaff

Silas Mournstaff, a brooding tiefling necromancer, was once a pupil to [Djimm](Djimm.md) before choosing to forsake his dark teachings. Now disillusioned with the Prophecies of Narrative, Silas wanders the haunted halls of the Ashen Monastery, seeking a way to undo the binding of his soul to the forbidden tome.
