Sir George, former Paladin of Balance, intentionally became dracolich to seek immortality and be with his love, [DAliz](DAliz.md). He balances Dâ€™Aliz's destructive nature and sometimes uses her undead horde for public works projects. Sir George believes in perfect dichotomy of good and evil and will aid his foes for fair fight.
