## Tass the Illusionist

Tass, a cunning gnome with a knack for deception, serves as a mediator between the barmy brainiac [Villalobos](Villalobos.md) and the inscrutable [Djimm](Djimm.md). Having grown up amidst the bustling [Bork](../Places/Bork.md) markets, Tass's unquenchable thirst for power led him to dabble in ancient magics and unsavory alliances. Holding the key to the entrance of the [Secret Barrow of Souls](../Places/Secret%20Barrow%20of%20Souls.md), Tass is sought after by heroes and villains alike, who hope to harness his knowledge for their own purposes.
