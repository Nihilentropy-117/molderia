## Thalia Nightstrike

Thalia Nightstrike is a daring human rogue raised in the bustling city of [Bork](../Places/Bork.md), known for her expertise in navigating the enigmatic menhir portals within [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon%20Vale.md). After a chance encounter with the elusive [Djimm](Djimm.md), she became an intermediary between the [Council of Seven](Council%20of%20Seven.md) and factions within [Bork](../Places/Bork.md). Trained by a trusted acolyte from the [Veils Edge](../Places/Veils%20Edge.md) monastery, Thalia has honed her skills to walk within the veil between life and death. Thalia now shoulders the burden of maintaining balance, darting between shadow and light in a world fraught with uncertainty and danger.
