## Theros Ironfist

Theros Ironfist, a mighty goliath barbarian, hails from the frozen tundras at the edges of the realm, beyond the treacherous terrain of [Bummehilldes](../Places/Bummehilldes.md). He was chosen by [Velindra the Silent Songstress](../Gods/Velindra%20the%20Silent%20Songstress.md), as her champion and granted the rare ability to harness the elemental power of the [Singing_Crystals_of_Inderloth](../Places/Singing_Crystals_of_Inderloth.md).
