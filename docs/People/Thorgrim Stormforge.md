## Thorgrim Stormforge

Thorgrim Stormforge, a dwarf paladin from Gothargiglas, was once a member of the Dwarven Councils before being cast out for his unorthodox methods. Despite his fall from grace, Thorgrim continues to investigate the dark connection between the Dwarven Council and the ancient beings in Darkmoon Vale, hoping to uncover the truth before it's too late.
