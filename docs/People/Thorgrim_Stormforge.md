## Thorgrim Stormforge

[Thorgrim Stormforge](../People/Thorgrim_Stormforge.md), a dwarf paladin from [Gothargiglas](../Places/Gothargiglas.md), was once a member of the [Dwarven_Councils](../Lore/Dwarven_Councils.md) before being cast out for his unorthodox methods. Despite his fall from grace, Thorgrim continues to investigate the dark connection between the Dwarven Council and the ancient beings in [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon_Vale.md), hoping to uncover the truth before it's too late.
