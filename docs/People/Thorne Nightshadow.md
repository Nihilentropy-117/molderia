## Thorne Nightshadow

Once a prominent ranger, Thorne Nightshadow renounced his allegiance after discovering evidence of corruption and a growing obsession with the [Tower of Rhanj](../Places/Tower%20of%20Rhanj.md) amongst his people's leaders. Joined by his loyal direwolf, Shadowfang, Thorne seeks to forge a new path by unearthing the dark secrets within [Morganna the Seer](Morganna%20the%20Seer.md)'s visions, and, in doing so, find a way to counteract the impending threat.
