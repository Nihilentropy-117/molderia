## Thorne Nightshadow

Once a prominent ranger, [Thorne Nightshadow](.md) renounced his allegiance after discovering evidence of corruption and a growing obsession with the [Tower of Rhanj](../Places/Tower_of_Rhanj.md) amongst his people's leaders. Joined by his loyal direwolf, Shadowfang, Thorne seeks to forge a new path by unearthing the dark secrets within [Morganna_the_Seer](Morganna_the_Seer.md)'s visions, and, in doing so, find a way to counteract the impending threat.
