## Uriel Dawnwalker

Uriel, a fallen angel seeking redemption, roams the dangerous landscapes of [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon_Vale.md), offering guidance to wayward travelers caught amidst fey, monsters, and wraiths. Saved by [Lirielle the Feybinder](Lirielle_Feybinder.md) from a deadly encounter with a [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md) guardian, he now fights at her side to protect the menhir circles from unbidden terrors. The haunted melodies of [Kalinda_the_Bard](Kalinda_the_Bard.md) draw Uriel out of seclusion, inspiring him to share the stories of his past and to strive for the balance he once missed. Some whisper he broke the ancient code of a heavenly order in a desperate bid to save a loved one from catastrophe.
