## Vanori Earthshaker

A stoic dwarf druid, Vanori Earthshaker was tasked by Jorvald Frostborn to forge an alliance with the half-giant Dbz, harnessing both their natural and elemental powers to reinforce the defenses of Targallene. Guarding a sacred stone located within the Weeping Ruins, his abilities draw upon the ancient magics of the Nethrael. While Vanori's loyalty lies with the dwarven council, he remains fiercely connected to the natural world, often finding solace in the Wailing Woods.
