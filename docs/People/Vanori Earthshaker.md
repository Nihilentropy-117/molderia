## Vanori Earthshaker

A stoic dwarf druid, Vanori Earthshaker was tasked by [Jorvald Frostborn](Jorvald%20Frostborn.md) to forge an alliance with the half-giant [Dbz](Dbz.md), harnessing both their natural and elemental powers to reinforce the defenses of [Targallene](../Places/Targallene.md). Guarding a sacred stone located within the [Weeping Ruins](../Places/Weeping%20Ruins.md), his abilities draw upon the ancient magics of the [Nethrael](Nethrael.md). While Vanori's loyalty lies with the dwarven council, he remains fiercely connected to the natural world, often finding solace in the [Wailing Woods](../Places/Wailing%20Woods.md).
