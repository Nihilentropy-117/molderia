## Vanori Earthshaker

A stoic dwarf druid, [Vanori Earthshaker](.md) was tasked by [Jorvald Frostborn](Jorvald_Frostborn.md) to forge an alliance with the half-giant [Dbz](Dbz.md), harnessing both their natural and elemental powers to reinforce the defenses of [Targallene](../Places/Targallene.md). Guarding a sacred stone located within the [Weeping_Ruins](../Places/Weeping_Ruins.md), his abilities draw upon the ancient magics of the [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md). While Vanori's loyalty lies with the dwarven council, he remains fiercely connected to the natural world, often finding solace in the [Wailing_Woods](../Places/Wailing_Woods.md).
