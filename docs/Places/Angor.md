Angor is a peculiar town nestled within a dense forest and a sprawling meadow of Dusk's Devourer Daisies, also known as the Fields of Dread. Named after the founder, an eccentric but brilliant druid, Angor is known far and wide for its unique natural phenomena and the rare artifacts that can be found within its borders.

A town shrouded in mystery and whimsy, Angor hosts a symbiosis of nature and magic unlike anywhere else. It is one of the few places where one can encounter the Curious Colonic Bees, tiny bioluminescent insects with the curious behavior of inhabiting the digestive tracts of large beasts.

**Key Locations:**

1. **The Fields of Dread:** This expansive meadow of Dusk's Devourer Daisies is both dangerous and mesmerizing. The carnivorous flowers bask in the sunlight during the day and are illuminated by the glow of the Curious Colonic Bees at night. Travelers are advised to keep their distance.
    
2. **The Luminous Apiary:** This is a research facility dedicated to studying the Curious Colonic Bees. Visiting scholars often provide quests to brave adventurers willing to explore the Fields of Dread for research samples.
    
3. **The Market of Marvels:** Here, you can find all manner of strange and wondrous items. Goods related to the unique local flora and fauna, like the Anal Beads of Angor, can be found among the stands.
    
4. **Elder's Hall:** A rustic, wooden structure where the Council of Elders meets. The council, composed of the town's oldest and wisest, governs Angor with fairness and wisdom. They also hold the knowledge of the town's peculiar history.
    
Angor's inhabitants are accustomed to living in harmony with the unusual elements of their surroundings. Many locals work as beekeepers, researchers, or herb collectors, dedicating their lives to understanding and preserving the natural wonders of their town. The people of Angor celebrate an annual festival known as the "Glowing Night," when the Curious Colonic Bees' bioluminescence is at its peak, casting the town in a mesmerizing, otherworldly light.
