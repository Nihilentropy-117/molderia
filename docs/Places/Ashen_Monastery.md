## The Ashen Monastery

Perched precariously atop the desolate mountain peak of [Bummehilldes](Bummehilldes.md), this long-abandoned monastery is shrouded in sinister tales and rumors of spectral disturbances linked to Djinn City. Brave heroes who scale its heights must face echoes of anguished souls, driven to despair by the mysteries of a forbidden tome. The victorious may glean secrets from this dark refuge, but at the cost of unsettling revelations.
