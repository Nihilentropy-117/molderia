## The Boundless Archive

Concealed within the depths of [Jorgenvault](Jorgenvault.md), [The Boundless Archive](.md) is a hidden repository of lore and magical knowledge compiled by generations of necromancers. Its ever-expanding shelves hold lost spells, obscure histories, and documents revealing the inner workings of once-thriving civilizations like [Azlant](../Lore/Azlanti.md). Those who dare to venture within the Archive risk being engulfed by its power, with only a handful ever escaping its cursed embrace.
