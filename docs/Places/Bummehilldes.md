## Bummehilldes

[Bummehilldes](.md), vast and desolate desert, is abode of nomadic tribes that eke out existence among its large, rounded hills. These roving clans display spectrum of attitudes, from hospitality to hostility, and their adaptability is matched only by their resilience. Survival among hazardous landscape is no easy task, as desert is teeming with dangerous creatures such as packs of vraxiss. In this harsh territory, travelers learn to appreciate small moments of wonder: arid wind carrying haunting melody, or sight of magical clock from [Jeepit Clocks](Jeepit_Clocks.md) melting amid sands, like beacon of hope in unforgiving land.
