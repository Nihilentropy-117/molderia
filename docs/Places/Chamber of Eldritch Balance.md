## The Chamber of Eldritch Balance

Nestled within [Gothargiglas](Gothargiglas.md) volcano, the Chamber of Eldritch Balance is an ancient place of sacred power, where order and chaos converge by cosmic design. Forged by [Ygrit the Runesmith](../People/Ygrit%20the%20Runesmith.md) as a gift to [Zorandar the Unyielding Flame](../Gods/Zorandar%20the%20Unyielding%20Flame.md), the Chamber is rumored to contain the [Nethrael](Nethrael.md) artifact sought by Valthor the Smith.
