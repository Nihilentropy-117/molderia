## The Chamber of Eldritch Balance

Nestled within Gothargiglas volcano, the Chamber of Eldritch Balance is an ancient place of sacred power, where order and chaos converge by cosmic design. Forged by Ygrit the Runesmith as a gift to Zorandar the Unyielding Flame, the Chamber is rumored to contain the Nethrael artifact sought by Valthor the Smith.
