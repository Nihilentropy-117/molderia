## The Chamber of Eldritch Balance

Nestled within [Gothargiglas](Gothargiglas.md) volcano, the Chamber of Eldritch Balance is an ancient place of sacred power, where order and chaos converge by cosmic design. Forged by [Ygrit the Runesmith](../People/Ygrit_Runesmith.md) as a gift to [Zorandar_the_Unyielding_Flame](../Gods/Zorandar_the_Unyielding_Flame.md), the Chamber is rumored to contain the [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md) artifact sought by Valthor the Smith.
