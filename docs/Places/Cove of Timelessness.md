## The Cove of Timelessness

The Cove of Timelessness is an enigmatic seaside grotto where the magical energies of Djimm's Tower in the West converge, causing time to flow differently within its confines. Within the cove, adventurers may discover relics of the past or glimpses of the future, as past and future intertwine. Venturing deeper into the cove, one risks being lost in time, disconnected from the present world while the Gods watche from the shadows, deciding the fate of those who dare challenge the limits of time.
