## The Crystal Observatory

Perched atop the highest peak of the Gothic Mountains, the Crystal Observatory is an ancient site where scholars from Bork gather to study the mysteries of the Two Moons. The Observatory's crystalline telescope, crafted by Renna the Runesmith, links directly to the Solarium of Whispers, allowing intrepid onlookers to attune themselves to the cosmic energies. However, delving too deeply into the Observatory's observations can lead to madness, as they whisper their cryptic truths, tempting those who seek forbidden knowledge.
