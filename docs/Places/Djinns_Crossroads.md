## Djinn's Crossroads

In the heart of [Djinn](../People/Djinn.md) City, the [Djinn](../People/Djinn.md)'s Crossroads is a mysterious nexus where the boundaries between planes become thin, connecting to various portals managed by [Jeepit the Time-Bound](../People/Jeepit_Time-Bound.md). This volatile center has become an essential hub for beings across the multiverse seeking to manipulate and learn the intricacies of time. However, meddling with the energies within [Djinn](../People/Djinn.md)'s Crossroads can lead to disastrous consequences for both the city and the planes beyond.
