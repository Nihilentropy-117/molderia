## The Eternal Gardens

Situated in the heart of Sylvania, the Eternal Gardens are a tranquil haven where non-violent vampires and all walks of life coexist, converging under the guardianship of an ancient and mystical tree. Here, the power of decay is reversed, and the fruits of the tree, harvested by the elves, grant temporary reprieve from aging and mortality. The gardens also serve as a peaceful resting place for the weary souls of lost rebels, suspended between life and death.
