## The Fogbound Sanctuary

In the dark heart of [Phandor Forest](Phandor Forest.md) lies the Fogbound Sanctuary, an ancient temple imbued with strange energies bestowed by [The Lady](../Gods/The%20Lady.md) herself. Enveloped in perpetual mist, a cryptic order of monks safeguards powerful symbols of luck and fortune.
