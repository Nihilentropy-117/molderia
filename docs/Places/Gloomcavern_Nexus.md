## Gloomcavern Nexus

Concealed within the shadows of [Darkmoon Vale](Darkmoon_Vale.md), the Gloomcavern Nexus is an underground subterranean network whose twisting passages span for miles beneath the forest floor. It serves as a secret meeting spot for the enigmatic Agents of the [Council of Seven](../Lore/Council%20of%20Seven.md), where they discuss their clandestine activities safely hidden from prying eyes.
