## Grayfalcon Castle

Grayfalcon Castle was built circa 320 by the wizard, Zagig Yragerne, who ruled over the Free City of Greyfalcon for 100 years before mysteriously disappearing. The castle's three towers, Zagig, War, and Magic, have decayed into ruins, and an extensive dungeon complex lies beneath them. The castle is now known as Grey Skull Castle and is mostly forgotten, except by history experts.
