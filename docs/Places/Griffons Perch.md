## Griffon's Perch

Griffon's Perch is a soaring cliffside citadel in the mountains surrounding [Bork](Bork.md). It is home to skilled warriors who have tamed and raised griffons to carry out unique flying combat techniques. Yet, the citadel houses an ancient artifact linked to the [Nethrael](Nethrael.md), and the warriors of Griffon's Perch are struggling to protect their home from both shifting politics and encroaching strange magical threats.
