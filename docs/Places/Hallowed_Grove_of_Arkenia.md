## The Hallowed Grove of Arkenia

Found on the fringes of [Darkmoon Vale](../Places/Darkmoon_Vale.md), the Hallowed Grove of Arkenia is a sacred and secluded woodland that flourishes under the watchful gaze of the ancient tree spirit, Arkenia. In the grove's heart, a spring fed by the waters of [Lake Tseepoo](../Places/Lake_Tseepoo.md) possesses unparalleled healing capabilities. However, visitors must first gain the approval of Arkenia by passing a trial that embodies the tenets of balance and harmony. Hidden within the grove, [Elsira Ravenshadow](../People/Elsira_Ravenshadow.md) and her eco-defenders have built a secret refuge to plan their efforts to preserve the delicate ecosystems of the Vale.
