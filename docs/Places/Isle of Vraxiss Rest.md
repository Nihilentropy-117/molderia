## Isle of Vraxiss' Rest

In the remote corner of the inland Sea lies the Isle of Vraxiss' Rest, a deserted island shrouded in the skeletal remains of slain Vraxiss packs. The island is believed to harbor relics from the Nethrael, and whispers of unrest among the bones fuel legends of powerful, dark artifacts. Brave adventurers navigating its hostile landscape must confront the ghosts of the past and heed the warnings of the Prophecies.
