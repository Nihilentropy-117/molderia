## Kavryth's Quagmire

In the heart of the woods north of [Sylvania](../Places/Sylvania.md) lies a bog steeped in dark legends and forbidden magics, said to have been cursed by the fallen sorcerer-king Kavryth for his failed quest to master the power in the [Prophecies of the Narrative](Prophecies%20of%20the%20Narrative.md). Those who venture into its depths are confronted by manifestations of their deepest fears and obsessions, forcing them to face the darkness within themselves. With every misstep, the quagmire threatens to devour both body and soul.
