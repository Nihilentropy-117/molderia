## The Lost Sanctuary of Eloria

In the treacherous swamps near Grayfalcon Castle, in an ancient and forgotten temple of the Nethrael, priestess Eloria remains shrouded in ivy and secrecy. The secrets of the temple are defended by the last living disciples of the Priestess, wielding enigmatic magics in her defense. Unraveling the temple's mysteries brings with it the risk of awakening long-dormant powers and releasing a devastating and transformative curse upon the world.
