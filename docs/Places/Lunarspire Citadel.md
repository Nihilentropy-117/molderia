## Lunarspire Citadel

This ancient, moonlit stronghold atop the Nightfall Peak houses a secretive order of knights dedicated to maintaining the balance between light and darkness. Led by a descendant of Sir George DracoLich they protect the realm from the resurgence of powerful evils like Hastur, while occasionally seeking guidance from The Lady. Behind its imposing, silver-lined walls, the knights study prophecies from the Book of Narrative, hoping to unearth secrets that may save the world.
