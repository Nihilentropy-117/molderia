## Mirrored Haven of Elira

Hidden within the tranquil depths of Phandor Forest lies a secret garden known as the Mirrored Haven of Elira. Enclosed by a shimmering, water-like barrier, this sanctuary is only accessible to those possessing pieces of the Solarium of Whispers sunbeams. Within its borders, The Lady's touch is palpable, and gentle whispers in the wind guide lost souls, hinting at their fates. Seekers of balance like Baelgor Earthshaker, are invariably drawn to this otherworldly refuge to commune with the enigmatic goddess.
