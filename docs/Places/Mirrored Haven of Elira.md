## Mirrored Haven of Elira

Hidden within the tranquil depths of [Phandor Forest](Phandor Forest.md) lies a secret garden known as the Mirrored Haven of Elira. Enclosed by a shimmering, water-like barrier, this sanctuary is only accessible to those possessing pieces of the [Solarium of Whispers](Solarium%20of%20Whispers.md) sunbeams. Within its borders, [The Lady](../Gods/The%20Lady.md)'s touch is palpable, and gentle whispers in the wind guide lost souls, hinting at their fates. Seekers of balance like [Baelgor Earthshaker](../People/Baelgor%20Earthshaker.md), are invariably drawn to this otherworldly refuge to commune with the enigmatic goddess.
