## Mourncliff Monastery

Perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the eastern edges of Bummehilldes desert, Mourncliff Monastery is sacred to the worshippers of the serpent deity that protects the Serpents Eye Oasis. This grand structure, adorned with ancient runes, is home to a sect of ascetic monks known for their serpentine combat moves and tireless meditation on enhanced sand.
