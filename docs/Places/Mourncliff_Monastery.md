## Mourncliff Monastery

Perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the eastern edges of [Bummehilldes](Bummehilldes.md) desert, [Mourncliff Monastery](.md) is sacred to the worshippers of the serpent deity that protects the [Serpents_Eye_Oasis](Serpents_Eye_Oasis.md). This grand structure, adorned with ancient runes, is home to a sect of ascetic monks known for their serpentine combat moves and tireless meditation on enhanced sand.
