## Nightshade Bastion

Embedded within the heart of Mogolo lies the enigmatic Nightshade Bastion, a formidable fortress forged from darkened, living wood that serves as a stronghold for the non-violent vampire faction. Bound by their common respect for the balance of nature, this unlikely alliance between the local tribes protects the woods from intruders who threaten the delicate order. Dimly lit and hauntingly beautiful, the bastion houses the ancient Codex of Shadows, a long-forgotten tome. Visitors may find refuge in the haunted corridors of the Nightshade Bastion, navigating its hidden twists and turns as they uncover dark secrets veiled in whispers.
