## Obsidian Spire of Oracles

Towering amidst the treacherous peaks of [Jorgenvault](Jorgenvault.md)'s mountains is the [Obsidian Spire of Oracles](.md), where time itself seems to weave and bend at the will of the ancient [Nethrael](../Lore/Nethrael.md) legacy. Enigmatic runes etched upon the structure reveal cryptic prophecies. Here, [Seladris the Eternal Soothsayer](../Gods/Seladris_Eternal_Soothsayer.md) bestows insights upon fortune-seekers and the desperate, yet many who enter are never seen again. Whether they uncover the secrets of their destiny or fall victim to the gravity of time remains unknown.
