## The Ossuary of Soraya's Shadows

Concealed within the labyrinthine passages of the [Tower_in_West](Tower_in_West) lies the Ossuary of Soraya's Shadows, a haunted gallery where [Soraya Rahavius](../People/Soraya%20Rahavius.md) displays her trophies of conquered dark forces. Each bone, meticulously etched with cryptic runes studied by [Renna the Runesmith](../People/Renna%20the%20Runesmith.md), tells a tale of Soraya's defiance against oppressive influence. Though lauded by the forces of balance, the Ossuary also houses dark energies that call to malevolent forces vying for control.
