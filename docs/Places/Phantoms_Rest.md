## Phantom's Rest

Known as the "City of Ghosts," this ethereal metropolis appears and disappears amongst Sudi. Spirits of ancient rulers roam the city's spectral streets, seeking redemption from their dark pasts by maintaining balance. The city harbors a sacred crypt, containing supernatural relics that can either unleash havoc or avert catastrophe, depending on the will of the one who wields them.
