Birthed from a seemingly innocuous communal love for a particular creamy condiment, this plane is a manifestation of shared faith that demonstrates the malleable boundaries of reality.

Covering an infinite expanse, this plane resembles an undulating ocean of ranch dressing. The viscosity of the dressing and the intoxicating aroma that permeates the air make the landscape quite unlike any other. The "terrain" varies, ranging from smooth, placid "lakes" to churning "rapids," all comprised of the very substance that defines this plane.

It is viewed as a symbol of abundance, pleasure, and the power of shared belief. Followers often visit this plane as a pilgrimage, seeing it as a manifestation of their collective faith in simple, tangible pleasures.

Though this plane seems hospitable, it does pose challenges for the unprepared. Navigating through its viscous landscape requires unique approaches. Believers often develop rituals and tools to make their journey, such as the Holy Ladle of Serving or the Great Bib of Protection. 

The Plane of Infinite Ranch Dressing, while perplexing to outsiders, holds a special place in the hearts of its believers. Itâ€™s a testament to the power of shared belief, an homage to a universally loved condiment, and a reminder that faith, in all its forms, can shape the multiverse in the most surprising ways. So, whether you find the idea delicious or daunting, remember - here, faith takes a form that's as tangible as it is tasty.
