## The Prismatium Arena

Built upon the remnants of [Infernocrest Keep](Infernocrest_Keep.md), the Prismatium Arena is a fortified battleground established by the victors of the ancient conflict against [Sir George DracoLich](../People/Sir_George_DracoLich.md). As the ultimate test of skill and valor, champions from each corner of the realm are drawn to the flash reflection of this enigmatic battleground. Encircled by a djinn-crafted magical barrier, warriors face otherworldly creatures and enchanted constructs created by D'jinn, and only through courage, willpower, and clever strategy can they prevail.
