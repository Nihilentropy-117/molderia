## The Prismglass Gardens

Concealed within the mountainous crags near [Jorgenvault](Jorgenvault.md), the Prismglass Gardens are a breathtaking sight to behold - a sanctuary amid the harsh landscape, filled with enchanted glass sculptures and crystal flora. The enchanted polymers refract the sunlight, creating a majestic display of colors and casting shards of prophecy in every direction. Careful study of the reflected patterns is said to reveal the inner workings of the High Elves' future - if one can withstand the overwhelming brilliance of the spectrum.
