## The Rift of Twilight

Found near the borders of Falcons Hollow and Darkmoon Vale, a tear in reality conceals an eerie, twilight realm, said to be connected to the ancient Nethrael. Mortals entering this liminal place find themselves in a world where light and darkness merge, and shadows whisper cryptic secrets. Those who embrace the power of twilight may gain mastery of the shadows or be consumed by the darkness within.
