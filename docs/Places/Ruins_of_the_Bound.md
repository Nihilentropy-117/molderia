## Ruins of the Bound

Deep within the Burning Sands, east of [Lake Tseepoo](../Places/Lake_Tseepoo.md), lies the [Ruins of the Bound](../Places/Ruins_of_Bound.md) - a testament to a fierce battle waged between [Djimm](../People/Djimm.md) and rival celestial forces. The very earth bears the scars of their struggle, infused with the lingering essence of their combined might. It is said that a time-stretched artifact from the Cove of Timelessness lies at the heart of the ruins, and whispers of [Morganna_the_Seer](../People/Morganna_the_Seer.md)'s presence can be heard echoing through the labyrinth of shattered chambers.
