## The Sands of Futurity

The Sands of Futurity is a peculiar oasis found within Bummehilldes where time and space become malleable, influenced by the energy of an ancient artifact from the Infinite Library. Djimm and Jeepit the Time-Bound have been seen frequenting this location, manipulating the environment as they gather hidden knowledge. Individuals attempting to harness the shattered remnants of time risk unraveling their own personal timeline.
