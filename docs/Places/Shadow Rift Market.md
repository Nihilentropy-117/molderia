## The Shadow Rift Market

Nestled in-between the dimensions and accessible only through magical portals, lies the Shadow Rift Market, a bustling bazaar teeming with merchants from places unknown, selling forbidden relics and powerful artifacts. Careful â€” the cunning Djimm is said to frequently visit this market, in search of new spell components and dark secrets. The market's prices often require more than mere gold, as strange beings eagerly trade fragments of fate for their coveted wares.
