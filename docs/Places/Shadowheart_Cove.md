## Shadowheart Cove

A refuge to weary souls drawn to its mesmerizing depths, the cove is both eerily tranquil and fraught with danger, as its entrance is zealously guarded by the colossal snake deity of the oasis. Within its confines, the intrepid may discover the entrance to the fabled Rift of Twilight.
