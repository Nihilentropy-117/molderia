## The Shattered Colonies

The Shattered Colonies is a vast archipelago marked by the remnants of [Azlanti Ruins](Azlanti%20Ruins.md), with each island on the brink of sinking beneath the waves. The survivors of the Azlant catastrophe, now hardened and cunning sea-farers, fervently protect their people and secrets from outsiders. The islands hide countless strange artifacts, some revealing cryptic warnings.
