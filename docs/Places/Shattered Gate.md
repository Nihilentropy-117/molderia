## The Shattered Gate

In the heart of the western desert, the Shattered Gate is the fragmented entrance to an ancient [Azlanti](Azlanti.md) vault. The gate, now shattered into innumerable pieces, is said to be only activated by replicating the time-worn melody from an ethereal song. Past the magical sands guarding the entrance lay herculean challenges and treasures beyond imagination, drawing the daring and the foolhardy alike.
