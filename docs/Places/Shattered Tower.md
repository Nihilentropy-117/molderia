## The Shattered Tower

Once a proud and elegant structure in the heart of [Gothargiglas](Gothargiglas.md), the Shattered Tower now stands as a bleak reminder of the city's dark history. The tower is said to be cursed after an encounter between the city's inhabitants and [Sir George DracoLich](../People/Sir%20George%20DracoLich.md), which resulted in a disastrous release of volatile magic. Within its cracked and crumbling walls lurk vengeful spirits and forgotten treasures, awaiting daring adventurers who have the courage to delve into the haunted remnants of the once-grand tower.
