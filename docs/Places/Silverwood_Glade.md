## The Silverwood Glade

Far inside the forest of [Phandor](Phandor_Forest.md), a serene woodland frequented only by [Kalinda_the_Bard](../People/Kalinda_the_Bard.md) and the isolated half-elf villagers. Enhanced by the energies flowing within [Darkmoon Vale](Darkmoon_Vale.md), the enchanted forest glows with an ethereal, silver hue, and the whispers of the Lady coax forth stories of heroism and loss. Travelers and adventurers exploring the glade must tread lightly, as secrets from their past or future may bloom before their eyes, whispers and prophecies guiding their uncertain steps.
