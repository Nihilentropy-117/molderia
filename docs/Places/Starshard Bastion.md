## The Starshard Bastion

Hidden deep within Mogolo, the Starshard Bastion is a formidable fortress built from fragments of fallen meteors that once destroyed ancient human empire Azlant. The fortress now serves as both a stronghold and a vault, housing remnants of the once-magnificent Nethrael circles that lie within its crystalline walls. Its guardians, the ethereal Starborn, work tirelessly to maintain balance amidst the delicate energies of the Leyline Nexus and the plots of the enigmatic Djimm.
