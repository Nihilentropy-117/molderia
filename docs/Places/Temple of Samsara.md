## The Temple of Samsara

Perched atop a serene hill, the Temple of Samsara is an enchanted monument dedicated to the Great Wheel of life, death, and rebirth. Its halls echo with ancient tales of sages who transcended the border between life and undeath, harnessing the harmonious powers of necromancy held within these sacred stones.
