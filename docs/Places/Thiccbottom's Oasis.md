Thiccbottom's Oasis, affectionately known as "Thiccbottom" by its residents, is a lively desert hamlet founded by the charismatic halfling entrepreneur, Whiffle Thiccbottom. What began as a single successful store in the middle of the desert grew into a thriving settlement, serving as a refreshing respite for weary travelers.

The hamlet is centered around a natural desert spring, with quaint adobe houses circling the water source. In this arid environment, the lush greenery surrounding the spring makes Thiccbottom's Oasis a sight for sore eyes.

**Key Locations:**

1. **Thiccbottom's Emporium:** This sprawling bazaar was the first establishment in what would later become Thiccbottom's Oasis. The Emporium sells a plethora of goods, from common travel provisions to rare desert artifacts.
