## The Underbridge Warrens

Beneath the great city of Targallene, the Underbridge Warrens stretch out in the darkness, home to shadowy guilds and clandestine activities. An unhealthily close alliance with the enigmatic Villalobos, who plies his trade in the shadows, ensures the underworld's connection to the wider web of intrigues, with whispers of his dealings with Djimm reaching the ears of those who dare to listen. The Warrens have become a crucial center for plots and schemes that impact the political landscape of Targallene itself.
