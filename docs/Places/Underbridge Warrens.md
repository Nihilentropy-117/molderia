## The Underbridge Warrens

Beneath the great city of [Targallene](Targallene.md), the Underbridge Warrens stretch out in the darkness, home to shadowy guilds and clandestine activities. An unhealthily close alliance with the enigmatic [Villalobos](../People/Villalobos.md), who plies his trade in the shadows, ensures the underworld's connection to the wider web of intrigues, with whispers of his dealings with [Djimm](../People/Djimm.md) reaching the ears of those who dare to listen. The Warrens have become a crucial center for plots and schemes that impact the political landscape of [Targallene](Targallene.md) itself.
