## The Vault of Frozen Time

Deep within the icy caverns beneath [Darkmoon Vale](Darkmoon%20Vale.md), the Vault of Frozen Time, guarded by [Jorvald Frostborn](../People/Jorvald%20Frostborn.md) himself, harbors ancient enchanted relics from [Phineas Satinshadow](../People/Phineas%20Satinshadow.md)'s research on time manipulation. As the icy walls encase time itself, those who venture into the vault find themselves entwined in the time-twisted fates.
