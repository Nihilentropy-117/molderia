## Veil's Edge

Resting high in the mountains neighboring Jorgenvault lies Veil's Edge, a secluded monastery where acolytes seek oneness with the veil that separates life from death. To ascend Veil's Edge, adventurers must first journey through the perilous trials of Jorgenvault and confront their own mortality.
