## Vortex of Sudi

The [Vortex of Sudi](../Places/Vortex_of_Sudi.md) is an enigmatic and chaotic storm surrounding the [Ruins of Sudi](../Places/Ruins_of_Sudi.md), created by the dark forces unleashed during the fall of the ancient civilization. Travelers seeking the magic artifacts hidden within the ruins must brave the turbulent storm, risking their lives in the process. Rumors tell of [Djimm](../People/Djimm.md) harnessing the storm's energy for use in the Necromancer's Tower.
