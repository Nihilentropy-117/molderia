## The Wailing Woods

Situated on the outskirts of Phandor Forest, this cursed forest emits a perpetual, cacophonous wail due to a rift in the planar fabric. Heroes who dare enter the twisted grove must face a barrage of vengeful spirits, haunted by their shattered fates. Ultimately, someone must seek to mend the rift, lest it spread its mournful song throughout the land.
