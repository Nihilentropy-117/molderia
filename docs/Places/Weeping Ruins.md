## The Weeping Ruins

Located within the vast Bummehilldes desert are the Weeping Ruins, remnants of an ancient city slowly being reclaimed by the unforgiving sands. According to rumors, the wandering Keeper of the Solarium of Whispers, Kalinda the Bard, once sought refuge in these ruins, which now whisper echoes of once-powerful spells. Those who dare to explore the ruins often encounter strange, time-twisted apparitions and magical anomalies.
