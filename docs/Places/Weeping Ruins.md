## The Weeping Ruins

Located within the vast [Bummehilldes](Bummehilldes.md) desert are the Weeping Ruins, remnants of an ancient city slowly being reclaimed by the unforgiving sands. According to rumors, the wandering Keeper of the [Solarium of Whispers](Solarium%20of%20Whispers.md), [Kalinda the Bard](../People/Kalinda%20the%20Bard.md), once sought refuge in these ruins, which now whisper echoes of once-powerful spells. Those who dare to explore the ruins often encounter strange, time-twisted apparitions and magical anomalies.
