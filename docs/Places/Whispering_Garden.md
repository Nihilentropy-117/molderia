## The Whispering Garden

A breathtaking sanctuary located within the enchanted forest of [HIELCIOFNONA](HIELCIOFNONA.md), The Whispering Garden is a sacred grove where trees sway gently, their leaves sharing ancient tales and forgotten lore with those who listen intently. Rumored to be a gift from [The Lady](../Gods/The%20Lady.md) herself.
