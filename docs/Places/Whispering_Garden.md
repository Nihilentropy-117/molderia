## The Whispering Garden

A breathtaking sanctuary located within the enchanted forest of [HIELCIOFNONA](../Places/HIELCIOFNONA.md), [The Whispering Garden](../Places/Whispering_Garden.md) is a sacred grove where trees sway gently, their leaves sharing ancient tales and forgotten lore with those who listen intently. Rumored to be a gift from [The Lady](The%20Lady.md) herself.
