## The Whispershroud Marsh

Enveloped by an eerie fog produced by the Rift of Twilight, the Whispershroud Marsh is a treacherous swamp inhabited by malevolent spirits and shadowy creatures. Those who dare enter must navigate its deceptive paths and heed the cryptic whispers of the ancient Nethrael ghosts, seeking to mislead or forewarn adventurers. The marsh hides a portal to the underworld, its location protected by Ilianna Stormbringer, who conjures fearsome storms to keep intruders at bay.
