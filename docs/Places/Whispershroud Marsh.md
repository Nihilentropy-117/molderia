## The Whispershroud Marsh

Enveloped by an eerie fog produced by the [Rift of Twilight](Rift%20of%20Twilight.md), the Whispershroud Marsh is a treacherous swamp inhabited by malevolent spirits and shadowy creatures. Those who dare enter must navigate its deceptive paths and heed the cryptic whispers of the ancient [Nethrael](Nethrael.md) ghosts, seeking to mislead or forewarn adventurers. The marsh hides a portal to the underworld, its location protected by [Ilianna Stormbringer](../People/Ilianna%20Stormbringer.md), who conjures fearsome storms to keep intruders at bay.
