The Goblins of Molderia are a fascinating study in the power of evolution and the influence of environment on a species. They are a far cry from their traditional goblinoid cousins, often described as "short hyper-intelligent orcs" rather than the typical goblin stereotype. 

Physically, Molderian Goblins are small, standing between 3.5 to 4.5 feet tall, and weighing between 50 to 70 pounds. They possess a robust constitution, a testament to their hardy orcish lineage. Their skin tones range from deep green to a rich, earthy brown, and their eyes are typically a vibrant yellow or gold. 

Molderian Goblins are renowned for their intelligence. They have a natural aptitude for problem-solving, strategic thinking, and arcane studies. This intellectual prowess, combined with their innate cunning and adaptability, has allowed them to rise to the top of Molderia's socio-economic ladder. 

Their society is built around a complex banking system, with the most powerful goblins controlling vast financial empires. They are masters of negotiation and manipulation, using their wealth and influence to shape the world around them. Their financial acumen is so renowned that it's often said a Molderian Goblin could sell a dragon its own hoard and make it feel like it got a bargain.

Despite their reputation for cunning and manipulation, Molderian Goblins are not inherently evil. They are pragmatic and driven by self-interest, but they are also capable of loyalty, kindness, and even altruism. They value knowledge, innovation, and progress, and they are willing to work with other races to achieve their goals.

Molderian Goblins have a unique relationship with magic. The Deucenium Impact has left them with an innate ability to manipulate the unique energies of this element. This has led to the development of a new form of magic, known as Deucenium Arcana, which is practiced almost exclusively by goblins.
