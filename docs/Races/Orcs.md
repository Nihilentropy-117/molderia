The Orcs of Molderia are a testament to the saying, "Brawn over brains." Towering over their goblinoid cousins, these hulking figures are the embodiment of physical prowess, with a penchant for chaotic behavior that is as endearing as it is terrifying.

Physically, Molderian Orcs are imposing, standing between 6 to 7 feet tall and weighing between 330 to 380 pounds. Their muscular frames are covered in a variety of skin tones, ranging from a deep, earthy brown to a vibrant green. Their eyes, typically a fiery orange or red, are a stark contrast to their skin and seem to burn with an inner fire.

Intellectually, Molderian Orcs are... well, let's just say they won't be winning any debates against their goblinoid cousins anytime soon. With an average intelligence score that is significantly lower than that of the goblins, the orcs of Molderia are often seen as the "dumb big brothers" of the goblin race. However, what they lack in intellectual prowess, they more than make up for in physical strength and endurance.

Their society is built around a system of might makes right, with the strongest orc often leading the tribe. Despite their chaotic nature, they have a strong sense of loyalty and camaraderie, especially towards their goblinoid cousins. They may fight and bicker amongst themselves, but when push comes to shove, they will always have each other's backs.

Molderian Orcs have a unique relationship with magic. While they lack the intellectual capacity to fully understand or manipulate the arcane, they have a natural resistance to magic, likely a result of their exposure to Deucenium. This resistance, combined with their physical strength, makes them formidable opponents on the battlefield.

In conclusion, while the Orcs of Molderia may not be the sharpest tools in the shed, they are a force to be reckoned with. Their physical prowess, combined with their loyalty and resilience, make them a valuable ally and a formidable foe. Just don't ask them to do any complex math.
