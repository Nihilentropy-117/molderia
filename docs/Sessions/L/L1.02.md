As the band of adventurers journeyed farther north, they encountered colossal ant hills. Standing before them, these massive earthen mounds loomed menacingly, as if guarding the secrets within. Undaunted, the party faced off against the hordes of ants and their fearsome queen. To their horror, they discovered that the queen ant had been twisted and transformed into an undead abomination, seemingly endowed with a newfound intelligence. This unnerving wisdom wasn't her own, but rather fragments of the fragmented mind of the long-lost King of Biting Ants. These flashes of insight fueled the monstrous queen's ambitions and drove her to ferocious ends.
