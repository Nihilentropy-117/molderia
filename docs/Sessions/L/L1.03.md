Battling the odds, the party ultimately emerged victorious, slaying the ants and their grotesque queen. They retrieved the ancient artifact, tainted by the curse that had ensnared Stuinvolk in its cold embrace. If the adventurers struck an accord with Bujune, he would remove the curse from Stuinvolk and allow them to carry away the treasure they had uncovered. However, this would only be possible once they had succeeded in dispelling the darkness that clung to the mysterious artifact.
