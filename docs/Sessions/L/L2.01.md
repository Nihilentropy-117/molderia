The players, having returned to Targallene, bid farewell to Stuinvolk, their companion of many battles. Their eyes then turned toward the Northlands, eager to explore its mysteries. With their route decided, they boarded an airship to travel through the vast skies towards their next destination.
The ongoing thread weaving through this adventure centered on the evolving relationship between the players and Sonya, a young druid girl. At just eleven years old, she was a feral child, her emotions as unpredictable and untamed as her burgeoning powers. Trust was a foreign concept for Sonya, and she regarded the members of the party with a cautious gaze. Her journey aboard the airship was tied to a critical mission: to safely escort this prodigiously talented druid to the Floating Citadel in the farthest reaches of the North.
As their voyage pushed onward, the airship sailed beneath a shroud of clouds that cast ghostly shadows over the landscape below. Their journey took an unexpected detour when the vessel was suddenly boarded by a horde of spectral pirates and sinister apparitions. Unyielding in the face of danger, the players fiercely engaged the spectral adversaries in a raging conflict. The clash culminated in one of the pirates being tossed overboard into the abyss, while the remainder were vanquished by the party's combined might. The haunting aura of the ghost ship dissipated, leaving nothing but silence in its wake.
