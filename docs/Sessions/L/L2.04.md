Later, the group found themselves in Falcon's Hollow, a remote, windswept village perched precariously on the outermost edge of Bork's vast cityscape. Seeking a moment of respite from the harrowing mountain passes they had traversed, they eagerly sought solace in the warm embrace of the 'Sitting Duck', a humble tavern known for its strong ale and lively atmosphere.
As the summer waned into autumn, painting the Darkmoon Wood in shades of jaundiced yellow and bloody crimson, the villagers of Falcon's Hollow were reminded yet again of the fleeting nature of life in Darkmoon Vale. It was here, in this bleak and forlorn corner of the realm, that a somber saying took root: "Sorrow becomes joy, joy rots to misery, and so all things turn bloody in the end."
The next stretch of their journey would take them westward through the treacherous Darkmoon Forest, a cursed land teeming with menacing fey creatures and unspeakable horrors. Undeterred by the challenges that lay ahead, the party forged on through the foreboding woods. They soon came upon a logging site, rumored to be the epicenter of egregious worker abuses. Stumbling upon a sinister plot, they discovered that a necromancer had infiltrated the camp, exerting his dark influence over the hapless loggers and raising them as undead thralls. Determined to put an end to this wickedness, the heroes clashed steel on steel, fighting bravely to liberate the camp from the necromancer's foul grasp.
