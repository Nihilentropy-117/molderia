They replenished their supplies, including a pound of allspice, and stashed their contraband in the local inn. With their affairs in order, they set out to seek an audience with the Vampire Queen.
The path led them northward, where they stumbled upon the peculiar Crow City and the enigmatic Djorgan Vault - the dwelling of the Vampire Queen herself. Upon receiving an audience with her, they were tasked with checking up on her grandfather in the Jorgenvault. After a complex web of encounters and agreements, Sir George the Dracolich agreed to escort the adventurers to the Grayfalcon Castle, where they hoped to negotiate with Datta for the power of the coveted Vorpal Blade.
