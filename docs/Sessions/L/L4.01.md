Once again, the heroes found themselves on a journey towards the intriguing dwarven city. This time, however, their path was upset by a cryptic message from D'jimm, the mysterious ally who informed them that their most straightforward solution was to seek out the modrons. To commence this quest, they would need to step through a hitherto undiscovered portal within the depths of Kastark Manor, found in the surprisingly useful location of the food pantry. Hidden behind the chilled goods, the portal connected to an alternate plane of existence, where an abandoned modron facility lay several days' march away.
These courageous adventurers embarked on this new venture, crossing the threshold into the unknown. They braved the barren, untamed lands until they reached the haunting and forsaken facility. Once inside, they spent days meticulously exploring its depths, unwittingly releasing an array of bizarre and terrifying creatures that scuttled and skulked through the network of pipes that lined the walls. With each step, they triggered an array of security systems, but their determination held strong as they persevered.
