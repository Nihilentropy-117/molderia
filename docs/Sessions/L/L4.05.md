The players soon find themselves summoned to the otherworldly Maelstrom Borderlands, a realm where the whims of the chaotic planes dwell in swirling disorder. Here, they must traverse the treacherous landscape to reach the the Temple of Infinite Law, an imposing structure nestled within the Planar Chaos itself. Their offense? Starting an interdimensional war and committing war crimes in the process.
As the court hearing unfolds within the hallowed halls of the Temple, the players plead their case. To their relief, they are absolved of their crimes, but there is a caveat â€” they are instructed to seek out an enigmatic oracle to learn their fate. With no other choice, they embark upon this new quest, hoping for answers to guide them through the trials that lie ahead.
Upon reaching the Oracle, a shrouded figure bearing an air of mystical wisdom, their hope dissipates like a wisp of smoke. The words that spew from the Oracle's lips are riddles and vagaries, swathed in the gossamer veil of prophecy. As the players listen to these cryptic messages, they come to the disheartening realization that the Oracle's guidance may be little more than useless generalities. Left with nothing but echoes of things they cannot comprehend, swirling within their minds, they wonder how they can possibly complete their journey and return to the lives they yearn for.
