With their mission accomplished, the players made their way back to the bustling dwarven city, its stone walls and forged iron gates a testament to the dwarfs' craftsmanship. The city hummed with activity as artisans and traders went about their daily routines. Upon their arrival, the players were ushered into the throne room to receive their reward from the dwarf king.
Seated on his regal stone scone throne, adorned with shining gemstones and intricate carvings, the dwarf king presented the players with an unusual offering - several large crates piled high in a dimly lit storeroom. It quickly became apparent that the king was likely attempting to clear out some of his long-forgotten storage spaces, for the crates contained an eclectic mix of items ranging from junk and garbage to priceless treasures.
As they rummaged through the crates, the players marveled at the assortment before them. There were finely crafted pieces of furniture, horse-drawn carriages, and suits of armor, interspersed with age-old wheels of cheese and bottles of wine. Glinting among the oddities were precious gemstones, their facets catching the torchlight just so.
Emboldened by their newfound wealth, the players decided to organize a caravan to traverse the vast expanse of the Grand Desert. They hired help, procured supplies, and set forth on a dusty, sun-baked journey towards the city of Morath-dor, the capital of the goblin financial empire.
