After slaying the foul creature, they delved into a hidden basement, revealing the infamous Infinite Library. This malevolent repository stood proud in the bowels of the underworld, its obsidian walls reflecting the sinister glow of the infernal books within. The air was rank with the scent of sulfur, punctuated by the distant wails of eternal torment.
The adventurers requested information about the Feast of Dust, and the library reluctantly offered them a tome on this subject. Within its pages, they discovered the story of the Jackal King and learned about the rich history of the desert region. Armed with this newfound knowledge, they left the accursed library and ventured further into the unforgiving sands.
