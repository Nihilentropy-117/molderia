Their unrelenting pursuit for a cure led them to the Whitewater Enclave, where they infiltrated the private residence of the Whitewater family. Amidst the decadent artifacts and grim remnants, they uncovered the horrifying truth: the Whitewater family were cultists of Hastur, the enigmatic Yellow King.
Descending deeper into the gloom of the family's basement, they found that the Jackal King was not their true adversary. Instead, he had been imprisoned by the insidious cultists, and the resulting Feast of Dust was an unintended consequence. The beleaguered monarch beseeched them to grant him his freedom, but first, they had to vanquish one of Hastur's disciples, the Chronomancer, who wielded the terrifying power of time itself.
Victorious against the temporal foe, our heroes liberated the Jackal King, who, true to his word, halted the Feast of Dust. To express his gratitude, he transported the adventurers back to the mercenary encampment, where they could finally rest and toast to their hard-won success.
