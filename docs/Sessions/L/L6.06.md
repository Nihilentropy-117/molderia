Chapter 37: Journey to the Mage's Guild

The team journeys from Azlanti Ruins to the Mage's Guild via the High Elven City and a goblin stronghold in the Northlands, using a Giant Trebuchet as a mode of transportation. They successfully retrieve a Goblin Chieftain's missing explosives from a cannibal goblin who killed her clan over a slain dog. The team decides to spare her and then returns the explosives to their ally, Villalobros, before proceeding back to the High Elven City.
