### Session 7.02 ###


Splitting up to search for three obelisks as directed by the Clan Wise Woman, the party finds themselves in the city of Carcosa due to their paladin's belief. They encounter a sentient mist and a temporary time loop, but manage to escape unscathed. The PCs arrive in the alien city of Carcosa and meet Queen Cassilda, who senses their allegiances and offers her assistance. She informs them of the threat of Hastur's ascension through the Star Stelae and the urgent need to disrupt it. The PCs then face the Pallid Mask, who offers them fealty to Hastur. They refuse, and after a fight, Cassilda reappears with the precise locations of the Star Stelae in Aevan-Vhor, Bohlvarai, and Paris.
