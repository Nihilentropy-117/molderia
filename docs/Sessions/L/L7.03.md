On arriving in Aevan-Vhor, they encounter a city with a strange reality where cursed undead live in obliviousness of their condition, and the living are in constant fear. At Mayor Eldarius's ruined estate, they meet the ghostly mayor, aware of his undead status. He pleads with the PCs to retrieve his daughter, Delmaria, transformed into a vampire, and the bard Erich Zann from another noble's estate. He promises to direct them to the Star Stela upon their return. The PCs visit the Azlanti museum, learning about the history of the Azlanti people and their deep-rooted connection with the Elder Being, Cthulhu. The unraveling mysteries add layers to their quest in the alien city.
