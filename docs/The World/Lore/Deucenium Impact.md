## Deucenium Impact

The impact of the Deucenium meteor led to the dispersal of Deucenium dust across Molderia. This unique metal suppressed the natural magic derived from the Azlanti Ioun Stones given to the Azlanti and instead, infused the land and its inhabitants with its own magical energies. This event led to the rapid evolution of the Azlanti, Porto-Orcs, and Porto-Dwarves into their modern forms, introducing an era where every being was inherently capable of spellcasting.
