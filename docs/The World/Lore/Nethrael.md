## Nethrael

The Nethrael were an ancient and mystical race of mithral elves that once dominated [Darkmoon Vale](Darkmoon%20Vale.md). Known for their exceptional skill in spellcraft, they left an indelible mark on the world with their intricate understanding of magic and its application. Although this vanished race's whereabouts and ultimate fate remain shrouded in mystery, their impact can still be felt and witnessed through various remnants that scatter the landscape.

One of the most significant and enduring legacies of the Nethrael are the menhir circles they constructed throughout Molderia. These mystical monuments, often made from immense stones and engraved with enigmatic runes, stand as testaments to their magical prowess and serve as focal points of potent arcane energy.

In their time, the Nethrael were revered for their mastery over magic, a talent that encompassed not only spellcraft but also the ability to manipulate the ley lines that crisscross the world. This deep connection they had with the ley lines allowed the Nethrael to create the [Leyline Nexus](Leyline%20Nexus.md), an immense cavern system located beneath the ancient ruins of Sudi. Within this cavernous labyrinth, the ley lines converged, creating a powerful vortex of magical energy that holds the key to unlocking great power and arcane wisdomâ€”though only for those who can decipher and survive the traps and guardians left behind by the Nethrael.

Apart from their magical prowess, the Nethrael were also skilled in the art of prophecy. Their foresight has been preserved through various inscriptions and documents, some of which remain hidden, waiting for seekers like [Faelora Starseeker](Faelora%20Starseeker.md) and [Estrella Moonshadow](Estrella%20Moonshadow.md) to uncover them. These prophecies contain insights into lesser-known civilizations and events that could potentially shake the foundations of the world.

Despite their incredible magical aptitude and gift of prophecy, the ultimate fate of the Nethrael remains unknown. Their disappearance marks an enigmatic chapter in the history of Darkmoon Vale, one that continues to be explored and debated by scholars and mages alike. Adventurers and knowledge seekers such as [Nariel Moonsong](Nariel%20Moonsong.md) and [Andromeda Nightshard](Andromeda%20Nightshard.md) continue to search for clues and remnants of this vanished race in hope of uncovering the truth behind the Nethrael and the powerful mysteries they left behind.
