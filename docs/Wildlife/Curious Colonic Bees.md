**Description:** Curious Colonic Bees, colloquially known as "Anal Bees," are a peculiar species of insect that inhabit the digestive tracts of large creatures in the icy expanse of Angor. These bees have adapted to an unusual environment, demonstrating a remarkable ability to survive and thrive within the confines of the intestinal tracts.

Physically, Curious Colonic Bees are diminutive creatures, measuring approximately 0.2 inches in length. They possess a slender, segmented body covered in a fine layer of iridescent hairs, giving them a shimmering appearance. Their wings, delicate and translucent, allow them to navigate the cramped and winding passageways of the digestive system with surprising agility.

Curious Colonic Bees have developed a unique symbiotic relationship with their hosts, forming an unusual partnership within the confines of the intestinal tracts. They feed on the remnants of digested food, extracting vital nutrients from the waste material. In return, their bioluminescent bodies emit a soft, ethereal glow, providing a source of light in the otherwise dark and gloomy environment of the digestive system.

The luminescent glow of the Curious Colonic Bees serves multiple purposes within the digestive tracts. Firstly, it aids in the illumination of the intestinal passageways, allowing the host creature to navigate more effectively via luminecent dung. This can be particularly useful in the case of nocturnal creatures or those that dwell in dimly lit environments.

Secondly, the bioluminescent glow of the bees attracts certain types of parasites that may have taken up residence within the digestive system. These parasites, disoriented by the unexpected light source, become easier targets for the host's immune system, aiding in their removal and reducing the risk of infection or infestation.

While the presence of Curious Colonic Bees within the digestive tracts may seem absurd, it is a testament to the remarkable adaptability of life in even the most unconventional environments. These bees have found a niche within the icy expanse of Angor, utilizing their unique traits to not only survive but also provide a beneficial service to their hosts.

Encountering Curious Colonic Bees within the digestive tracts of creatures in Angor can be a fascinating yet surreal experience. The soft glow emitted by these tiny insects creates an otherworldly ambiance within the abdomen. However, adventurers should exercise caution and maintain a respectful distance, as disturbing the delicate balance of the digestive system can have unintended consequences.
