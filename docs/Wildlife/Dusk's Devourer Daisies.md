There exists a unique ecosystem centered around the Curious Colonic Bees and a plant known as the Devourer Daisies.

Devourer Daisies, unlike their benign counterparts, are oversized, carnivorous plants with bright, sun-like flowers that can extend on long, flexible stalks to ensnare their prey. When they capture a creature, they utilize it as both a source of nutrition and a hive for the Curious Colonic Bees.

After capturing a creature, a Devourer Daisy injects it with a swarm of dormant Anal Bee eggs. Once inside the creature's digestive system, the eggs hatch, and the bioluminescent bees come to life. The bees serve a dual purpose: they light up the interior of the Daisy, attracting more prey, and they also help decompose the captured creature, aiding the Daisy's digestion process.

Fields of these Devourer Daisies, guarded by luminescent swarms of Curious Colonic Bees, create a sight both mesmerizing and terrifying. These fields could serve as dangerous obstacles for your adventurers to navigate, requiring them to exercise stealth and cunning to avoid getting captured by the predatory plants or swarmed by the bees.
