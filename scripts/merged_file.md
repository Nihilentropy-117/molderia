Undaunted, the party faced off against the hordes of ants and their fearsome queen. To their horror, they discovered that the queen ant had been twisted and transformed into an undead abomination, seemingly endowed with a newfound intelligence.

The ongoing thread weaving through this adventure centered on the evolving relationship between the players and Sonya, a young druid girl. At just eleven years old, she was a feral child, her emotions as unpredictable and untamed as her burgeoning powers. Trust was a foreign concept for Sonya, and she regarded the members of the party with a cautious gaze. Her journey aboard the airship was tied to a critical mission: to safely escort this prodigiously talented druid to the Floating Citadel in the farthest reaches of the North.
As their voyage pushed onward, the airship sailed beneath a shroud of clouds that cast ghostly shadows over the landscape below. Their journey took an unexpected detour when the vessel was suddenly boarded by a horde of spectral pirates and sinister apparitions. Unyielding in the face of danger, the players fiercely engaged the spectral adversaries in a raging conflict.

As they forged this newfound alliance, the monkeys revealed to the heroes the location of an archaeological dig site to the east: the very spot where the cultists first set foot upon the island.
With renewed determination, the players ventured towards the dig site, uncovering an ancient cave painting hidden within. The painting illustrated the elder winged gods who once dwelled atop a nearby mountain. Taking this as a divine signal, the players followed the treacherous mountain pass up towards the ancient Azlant temple nestled within its peak.
Much to their surprise, they discovered that the once-great temple now lay in ruins, destroyed millennia ago by a catastrophic meteor impact during the great Earthfall. In the center of the impact crater, a yawning chasm beckoned them downwards into the long-lost Azlant city buried beneath the mountain.
As they explored the subterranean metropolis, the players soon realized that the dwarven power stones in their possession were in fact evolved versions of the Azlant Ioun stones -- and thus could harness the power of the abandoned Azlant technology that lay dormant in the hidden city. The secrets of the past and the key to stopping the cultists were now within their grasp as they delved deeper into the heart of darkness.

---CHAPTER 37---

The team journeys from Azlanti Ruins to the Mage's Guild via the High Elven City and a goblin stronghold in the Northlands, using a Giant Trebuchet as a mode of transportation. They successfully retrieve a Goblin Chieftain's missing explosives from a cannibal goblin who killed her clan over a slain dog. The team decides to spare her and then returns the explosives to their ally, Villalobros, before proceeding back to the High Elven City.
---CHAPTER 38---

On their visit to the High Elven Capital, the team’s possession of Hastur's Yellow King playbook attracts the attention of the mages at the Mage's Guild. The book is confiscated, and the team is sent to an underwater city, Rylath, where they meet Elder Being Cthulhu. Tasked with stopping Cthulhu's brother, Hastur, the team is sent to Hastur's realm, Carcosa. A desert fight with two giants leads them to a bar where they meet another team sent by Djimm the Necromancer with a similar mission.
---CHAPTER 39---

Splitting up to search for three obelisks as directed by the Clan Wise Woman, the party finds themselves in the city of Carcosa due to their paladin's belief. They encounter a sentient mist and a temporary time loop, but manage to escape unscathed. The PCs arrive in the alien city of Carcosa and meet Queen Cassilda, who senses their allegiances and offers her assistance. She informs them of the threat of Hastur's ascension through the Star Stelae and the urgent need to disrupt it. The PCs then face the Pallid Mask, who offers them fealty to Hastur. They refuse, and after a fight, Cassilda reappears with the precise locations of the Star Stelae in Aevan-Vhor, Bohlvarai, and Paris.

---CHAPTER 40---

On arriving in Aevan-Vhor, they encounter a city with a strange reality where cursed undead live in obliviousness of their condition, and the living are in constant fear. At Mayor Eldarius's ruined estate, they meet the ghostly mayor, aware of his undead status. He pleads with the PCs to retrieve his daughter, Delmaria, transformed into a vampire, and the bard Erich Zann from another noble's estate. He promises to direct them to the Star Stela upon their return. The PCs visit the Azlanti museum, learning about the history of the Azlanti people and their deep-rooted connection with the Elder Being, Cthulhu. The unraveling mysteries add layers to their quest in the alien city.
---CHAPTER 41---

The party infiltrated the mansion where the blood moon vampire ritual was to take place. Kable was lured upstairs with Turkus by a pair of twins who turned out to be a wight and a warewolf. In the resulting fight Turkus was cursed with undeath. Kable as a dragon rampaged through the house, causing the party to disperse, and freed the Mayors Daughter. They rescued The Musician from his chamber, and he offered to open the Azlanti Song-Gate with his knowledge. They opened the Obilisk, and destroyed the Staelae, only to be confronted by Hastur himself, who removed Sori's mouth in order that he might be heard.
