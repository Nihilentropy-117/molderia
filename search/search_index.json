This land of contrasts and contradictions is steeped in ancient history, shaped by cosmic entities, and ruled by a powerful banking guild of goblins.</p> <p>Molderia's story begins with two tribes, the Azlanti, an early human tribe, and the Nethrael, the Mithril Elves. Their lives were forever changed when a cosmic entity, bestowed upon them powerful Stones imbued with magic. The Azlanti, under the influence of these Stones, built a civilization of unprecedented splendor and wisdom. The Nethrael, on the other hand, were gifted with innate spellcasting abilities.</p> <p>However, the Azlanti's misuse of the Stones' magic led to a cosmic retribution. A meteor teeming with a mysterious element called Deucenium was hurled towards Molderia. This event, known as the Deucenium Impact, dispersed the element across the land, suppressing the natural magic and replacing it with its own unique energies. This transformative event led to the rapid evolution of the Azlanti, Porto-Orcs, and Porto-Dwarves into their modern forms, and the disappearance of the Nethrael.</p> <p>The Nethrael, despite their disappearance, left an indelible mark on Molderia. Their menhir circles, intricate understanding of magic, and ability to manipulate the ley lines that crisscross the world are testaments to their magical prowess. Their prophecies, preserved through various inscriptions and documents, continue to intrigue adventurers and knowledge seekers.</p> <p>In the modern day, Molderia is run by a powerful banking guild, made up mostly of goblins. They control the economy and government of the land with an iron fist. Despite their small stature, the goblins have built a vast network of banks and financial institutions that span the entire continent, controlling the flow of money and resources.</p> <p>The other races of Molderia, including humans, elves, orcs, and dwarves, participate in the economy under the watchful eye of the goblins. Despite the goblins' dominance, these races have found ways to thrive. Humans have become expert traders and merchants, elves and dwarves excel in specialized industries, and orcs have found their place as mercenaries.</p> <p>However, the goblins' control has led to a great deal of inequality and suffering. While they enjoy lives of luxury and excess, many of the other races struggle to survive. This has led to rumblings of revolution and rebellion in some parts of the continent.</p> <p>Molderia is a land of great wealth and power, but also of great inequality and suffering. It is a place where the pursuit of wealth is both celebrated and condemned, and where the power of money reigns supreme. Whether you're an adventurer seeking ancient mysteries, a merchant navigating the treacherous economy, or a rebel fighting for equality, Molderia offers a unique and challenging journey.</p>"},{"location":"The%20Tower%20in%20the%20West/","title":"The Tower in the West","text":"<p>The Tower in the West, often referred to simply as 'The Tower,' is a location steeped in mystery and ancient magic.

Always yearning for certainty, groping blindly in the dark for that elusive thread of unchanging truth. You do not seek divine enlightenment, nor spiritual transcendence, but rather a philosophical rock upon which to anchor your transient lives. You yearn for a glimpse of the Everlasting, a taste of the immutable that defies the chaos of your existence. You crave the sublime, that which transcends the ephemeral and glorifies being, a beacon illuminating the dark seas of life. It matters little whether this sublime exists in reality, or merely as a figment of your pitiful imaginings. For you, the mere belief in such a beacon is a balm to the raw wounds of your existence. So you dream of your Carcassonne, your utopia built of sand and sea foam. You stitch together a tapestry of hope from the tattered remnants of your reality, weaving illusions and masks to obscure the stark disappointment of your mundane existence. This, at least, you believe to be better. But what you fail to grasp, my dear uninvited guests, is that beneath the mask of your hopeful illusions, beneath the shining beacon of your dreams, lies the unspeakable horror of the void. The vast, uncaring cosmos in which your existence, your truths, your dreams are but motes of dust swept away in the cosmic winds. Behold, I am Hastur, the King in Yellow. I am the avatar of that void, the embodiment of the cosmic horror that lurks just beyond the thin veneer of your illusions.

We lived, we died, expecting to awaken in our promised paradise. But alas, our god had fallen, our paradise with him. What awaited us was not the heavenly city we had dreamt of, but a desolate wasteland echoing with the lament of its abandoned souls. Imagine expecting heaven, only to find a barren, godless realm. Imagine the horror of discovering this truth not in death, but in life. Whether you believe in heaven or not, the thought of an eternity spent in such a place is enough to shatter the sanity of any man. And so we come to Hastur, the King in Yellow. Once a man like us, reborn in this desolate realm, he chose to rule over the ruins, the false king of a fallen heaven. See Carcosa for what it truly is, and know the horror of the King in Yellow's rule.\"</p> <p>--King Aer, to the Party</p> <p>\"Ah, you mortals. Always yearning for certainty, groping blindly in the dark for that elusive thread of unchanging truth. For you, the mere belief in such a beacon is a balm to the raw wounds of your existence. So you dream of your Carcassonne, your utopia built of sand and sea foam. You stitch together a tapestry of hope from the tattered remnants of your reality, weaving illusions and masks to obscure the stark disappointment of your mundane existence. This, at least, you believe to be better.</p> <p>But what you fail to grasp, my dear uninvited guests, is that beneath the mask of your hopeful illusions, beneath the shining beacon of your dreams, lies the unspeakable horror of the void. </p> <p>Behold, I am Hastur, the King in Yellow. I am the avatar of that void, the embodiment of the cosmic horror that lurks just beyond the thin veneer of your illusions. The dread you feel at my name, the horror that gnaws at your sanity, is but a glimmer of the true terror of the universe. Welcome to my realm, where masks fall away, and illusions shatter. Welcome to the harsh light of reality.\"</p> <p>--Hastur, to the Party</p>"},{"location":"Lore/Religion%20-%20Faiths%20%26%20Beliefs/","title":"Religion   Faiths & Beliefs","text":"<p>In the vast multiverse of this world, gods and their power are shaped by the fervor, faith, and collective belief of their followers. The very fabric of divine existence, their strength, and influence are directly tied to the degree of worship they receive. From the highest pantheon deity to the smallest elemental spirit, all draw their energy from the attention and devotion directed toward them.</p> <p>While this may seem to be a straightforward concept, the practical implications are endlessly fascinating. For example, a god worshipped by millions might wield power beyond comprehension, able to shape the world in their image, while a deity forgotten by time becomes a mere whisper in the cosmic winds, bereft of any influence they once had.</p> <p>More intriguingly, the divine doesn't confine itself to conventional gods. Entities without an inherent divine nature, when revered by a significant mass of believers, can ascend to a godlike status. An ancient tree, a revered ancestor's relic, or even an ordinary rock might manifest divine powers if enough faith is vested in it. These instances blur the lines between what is a god and what isn't, making the divine a truly democratic domain.</p> <p>This interplay between gods and mortals often brings to mind the metaphor of a pool filled by streams of faith. Each stream represents the belief from each mortal, collectively filling the pool, empowering the divine entity.</p> <p>This belief-driven system brings a unique dynamic to divine and mortal relations. It's not unusual for gods to take a more active role in their followers' lives, driving their agendas and cultivating their faith, for their very existence depends on it. This in turn leads to a world where divine intervention isn't just hoped for, but expected. It's part of the daily ebb and flow of life, death, and everything in between.</p> <p>Religion in this world isn't a static, immovable tradition. It's a vibrant, living concept that grows, evolves, and occasionally fades away. It's not uncommon for new gods to arise from the most humble beginnings, or for once-great gods to fade into obscurity, forgotten by their followers. The divine landscape is ever-changing, much like the people who shape it with their faith.</p> <p>Yet, even in this flux, many questions remain. What makes a god? Is it the divine powers they wield or the faith they inspire? Can anything become a god, given enough belief? And what happens to a god when the last of their followers forgets their name? These questions are perhaps not meant to be answered definitively, but they serve to remind us of the fascinating relationship between gods and those who believe in them.</p> <p>In the end, faith is not just a concept or a guiding principle. It's a fundamental force, as real and tangible as magic. It shapes the divine and, in turn, is shaped by it. This reciprocal relationship is what breathes life into the pantheon, turning mere belief into divine reality. It's a testament to the power of faith, and a reminder that, in this world, belief can truly move mountains, or in some instances, make a rock cast spells.</p>"},{"location":"Lore/The%20Old%20Ones/","title":"The Old Ones","text":""},{"location":"Lore/The%20Old%20Ones/#the-old-ones","title":"The Old Ones","text":"<p>The Old Ones, also known as the Cosmic Entities, are a group of powerful and enigmatic beings central to the mythology and ancient history of the world of Molderia. Known for their unparalleled knowledge and power that transcends the mortal realm, these beings have deeply influenced the course of Molderia's history, most notably the rise and fall of the Azlanti civilization.</p> <p>The Old Ones are often described as inscrutable, existing beyond the conventional dimensions of time and space. They embody a variety of forms, many of which defy the confines of human comprehension, reflecting their transcendental nature. Despite their myriad appearances, they are united by their possession of vast cosmic knowledge and the ability to manipulate reality on a scale far beyond mortal capacity.</p> <p>The Old Ones first intervened in Molderia's timeline by aiding the primitive Azlanti humans, whom they found intriguing. Through subtle manipulations and sharing cryptic secrets, they guided the Azlanti, enabling their transformation from primitive tribes into a thriving civilization, thereby initiating the era of the Azlanti Empire.</p> <p>Despite their pivotal role in the rise of the Azlanti, the Old Ones played an equally critical part in their downfall. When the Azlanti began to misuse their powers and knowledge, the Old Ones responded by triggering the Deucenium Impact, a cataclysmic event that drastically altered Molderia and its inhabitants.</p>"},{"location":"Lore/The%20Prophesies%20of%20the%20Narrative/","title":"The Prophesies of the Narrative","text":"<p>A fellowship, bound by faith and courage, Marked by the tribes, both wise and savage, Yet they shalt not enter the maw, For a needle shall guide, cutting the veil.</p> <p>--Walthar Leafblade</p> <p>When the light begins to fade, Upon the land, there towers monuments of earth, a Queen's loathsome brilliance, a crown rests, Humbled by the weight of a deathless death, In fragmented thoughts to fuel ambition.</p> <p>Yet all shall not be as it seems.

These stones are found naturally in the Nethrael's ancestral home of Darkmoon Vale, and their power is deeply intertwined with the land itself.</p> <p>Unlike the artificial and dirty magic of the Azlanti Stones, Nethrael Stones are conduits of a more natural and harmonious form of magic. The Nethrael, a mystical race of mithral elves, were blessed with inherent magical abilities simply by growing up around these stones. This magic is akin to the druidic or shamanic traditions, drawing power from the natural world and the ley lines that course through it.</p> <p>Nethrael Stones offer a consistent and varied source of magic. While they may not possess the raw power of the Azlanti Stones, they make up for it with their versatility and reliability. The magic channeled through these stones is clean and pure, allowing users to tap into a wide range of spells and abilities that align with the natural forces of the world.</p> <p>One of the unique aspects of Nethrael Stones is their ability to enhance and amplify the innate magical abilities of the Nethrael. By attuning to a Nethrael Stone, a spellcaster can tap into its power, unlocking new depths of their magical potential. This attunement process allows the user to access a broader repertoire of spells and abilities, expanding their magical horizons.</p> <p>Furthermore, Nethrael Stones have a symbiotic relationship with the land of Darkmoon Vale. They draw upon the natural energies of the environment, amplifying the connection between the user and the ley lines. This connection grants the user a heightened awareness of their surroundings and the ability to tap into the latent magic that flows through the land.</p> <p>It is important to note that Nethrael Stones are not mere tools or trinkets. They are deeply tied to the Nethrael's culture, history, and spiritual beliefs. The stones are revered and treated with great respect, as they are seen as gifts from the Old Ones and a symbol of the Nethrael's connection to the natural world.</p> <p>Adventurers who seek to harness the power of Nethrael Stones must approach them with reverence and an understanding of the delicate balance between magic and nature. With proper attunement and respect for the natural forces, these stones can unlock a world of magical possibilities and allow the user to become a conduit of the ancient and mystical powers of the Nethrael.</p> <p>Nethrael Stones possess a unique property that makes them both alluring and dangerous to those who are not of Nethrael descent. If a non-Nethrael attempts to use a Nethrael Stone, it will grant them a surge of power, enhancing one of their skills or abilities. This boost is often significant, allowing the user to surpass their previous limitations and achieve feats they never thought possible.</p> <p>However, this enhancement comes at a great cost. The moment a non-Nethrael taps into the power of a Nethrael Stone, the stone shatters and dissolves, its essence consumed in the process. This irreversible destruction of the stone is a testament to the unique bond between the Nethrael and their ancestral gems.</p> <p>The shattered remnants of the stone hold no magical properties and are rendered useless. This serves as a stark reminder that the power of the Nethrael Stones is meant exclusively for those of Nethrael lineage, and attempting to wield it without the proper heritage leads to the loss of both the stone and its potential future benefits.</p> <p>This aspect of Nethrael Stones adds an element of caution and restraint for adventurers who come across these precious gems. While the allure of a boost in skills or abilities may be tempting, the risk of permanently losing the stone and its inherent magical properties should not be taken lightly.</p> <p>It is worth noting that there are rare instances where non-Nethrael individuals have managed to harness the power of a Nethrael Stone without triggering its destruction. These cases are exceptional and often involve deep connections to the natural world or a profound understanding of the Nethrael's culture and magic.

With a deep reservoir of knowledge about magic and history, obtained during his years of rigorous study in the ancient Jorgenvault - a monolith shrouded in mystery and veiling secrets within its decayed ruins - Djimm's understanding of the world is profound and layered.</p> <p>He fills the shoes of his predecessor as the realm's necromancer, having evaded the corruption typically associated with the magic of the tower. An uneasy truce exists between him, the tower, and the realm's inhabitants. They tolerate him because, unlike past necromancers, he inflicts far less property damage.</p> <p>At a superficial glance, Djimm might seem to be nonchalant and carefree.

This malevolent entity, often referred to as The King in Yellow, is believed to be confined within La\u00e5\u00e5ke Hali, a vast body of water on this celestial body.</p> <p>Once, this unnamed planet was home to two main civilizations - Alar, an aggressive and rebellious society, and Yhtill, a city of artisans and aristocrats, known for its stagnation and decadence. Carcosa was the third metropolis, an abandoned city-state that predates the mud-and-stick settlements of Alar and Yhtill. It's said that Carcosa would appear across Lake Hali during the black sunsets, fostering many legends, with some suggesting it was Hastur's home before his imprisonment.</p> <p>Transformation of Carcosa</p> <p>Hastur, not content with confinement, devised a strategy for his liberation. He manipulated the people of Alar and Yhtill to facilitate the conversion of Carcosa into a tool for his release and subsequent apotheosis into an Outer God. Hastur mystically united the three cities, causing Alar and Yhtill to be absorbed into Carcosa, thereby reanimating its dormant structures.</p> <p>In this transformation, Alar contributed its aggressive spirit, while Yhtill lent the new Carcosa its power of corruption. In the process, however, a fragment of Yhtill's vitality found a host in Queen Cassilda, making her a lesser immortal and the first inhabitant of the reformed Carcosa.</p> <p>Living Entity and Parasitic Function</p> <p>Carcosa transcends the ordinary definition of a city. It is a living, alien entity that can establish mystical connections to distant civilizations and drain their cultural life force. Through this process, Carcosa grows, assimilating a twisted replica of the consumed city into itself, which is referred to as a nexus. This predatory action ultimately leads to the entire city and its inhabitants being transported to Carcosa.</p> <p>Furthermore, Carcosa can establish these connections through complex rituals often embedded in performance arts like plays. An example of such a ritual is hidden within the theatrical play \"The King in Yellow,\" which can incite madness among viewers or even transport them directly to Carcosa.</p> <p>Inhabitants and External Influences</p> <p>Carcosa is inhabited by monstrous creatures, including the flying polyps that serve Hastur after one of their cities was devoured by Carcosa. Additionally, the Great Old One Xhamen-Dor, an infestation within Carcosa's sewers, aids in the city's growth by corrupting planets and siphoning psychic energy back to Carcosa.</p> <p>Carcosa currently contains nexuses of over 100 cities, but only three cities are known as of this date - Aevan-Vhor, an ancient Azlanti city; Bohlvarai, the ruins of a city where shoggoth slaves rebelled; and a section of Paris from Earth, taken during a mishap involving the performance of \"The King in Yellow.\"</p> <p>Physical Properties</p> <p>Carcosa exists on the Material Plane, in a far-off cosmic location from Golarion.

It is a place where the pursuit of wealth is the highest virtue, and money reigns supreme over all other values. The continent is run by a powerful banking guild, made up mostly of goblins, who control the economy and government of the land with an iron fist.</p> <p>The goblins of Molderia are a cunning and ruthless lot, with an almost preternatural ability to manipulate numbers and finance. They are responsible for the creation and management of the continent's currency, the Mold, which is used by all of the different races who call Molderia home.</p> <p>Despite their small stature, the goblins of Molderia are able to maintain their dominance through sheer force of will and intelligence. They have built a vast network of banks and financial institutions that span the entire continent, and they use this power to control the flow of money and resources.</p> <p>The other races of Molderia are forced to play by the goblins' rules if they want to survive and thrive in this harsh, capitalist world. Humans, elves, orcs, and dwarves all participate in the economy, but they do so under the watchful eye of the goblins. The goblins allow these other races to conduct business, but they take a significant cut of the profits and use their financial power to keep the other races in check.</p> <p>Despite the goblins' dominance, the other races of Molderia have found ways to thrive in this system. Humans, in particular, have become expert traders and merchants, able to navigate the treacherous waters of the Molderian economy with skill and cunning. Elves and dwarves, meanwhile, have found success in specialized industries such as jewelry-making and metalworking.</p> <p>Orcs, who are often thought of as brutish and violent, have also found their place in the Molderian economy. Many orcs have become mercenaries, selling their skills as soldiers to the highest bidder. While this may seem like a dangerous and unstable way to make a living, many orcs find that it offers them a level of freedom and independence that they cannot find elsewhere in Molderian society.</p> <p>Despite the relative success of the other races, however, it is clear that the goblins hold all the cards in Molderia. They are the ones who control the economy, and they are the ones who make the rules. This has led to a great deal of inequality and suffering for many of the non-goblin inhabitants of the continent.</p> <p>While the goblins enjoy lives of luxury and excess, many of the other races struggle just to get by. There is little in the way of social safety nets or welfare programs in Molderia, and those who fall on hard times are often left to fend for themselves. This has led to a great deal of resentment and anger among the non-goblin population, and there are rumblings of revolution and rebellion in some parts of the continent.</p> <p>Despite these challenges, Molderia remains a fascinating and complex place. It is a land of great wealth and power, but also of great inequality and suffering. The goblins who run the continent are both admired and reviled, respected for their financial prowess but despised for their cruelty and greed.</p> <p>For those who are able to navigate the treacherous waters of Molderia's economy, there is great opportunity and potential for success. But for those who cannot, life in this Financial Plutocracy can be brutal and unforgiving. It is a land of great contrasts and contradictions, where the pursuit of wealth is both celebrated and condemned, and where the power of money reigns supreme over all other values.</p>"},{"location":"Places/Monarchs%20Seat/","title":"Monarchs Seat","text":""},{"location":"Places/Monarchs%20Seat/#the-monarchs-seat","title":"The Monarch's Seat","text":"<p>Deep within Grayfalcon Castle lies the Monarch's Seat, a hidden throne room that controls the remnants of Zagig Yragerne's ancient magical defenses.

The party embarked on a series of thrilling escapades in this fantastical land, their camaraderie strengthening with each bizarre encounter. Among the many outlandish tasks they undertook, one stands out as the most pivotal and perilous: slaying the fearsome Jabberwocky, a dreaded creature that plagued the land. The paladin, a staunch defender of virtue and righteousness, led the charge against the fearsome beast. With unwavering determination and ironclad faith, the holy warrior clashed against the monstrous adversary. At the end of the grueling battle, the Jabberwocky lay defeated at their feet. Through this heroic feat, the Paladin was granted a vorpal sword, its deadly blade imbued with eldritch energies capable of severing the very fabric of existence, or just a few heads. As their adventure in Wonderland continued, the sorcerer and rogue, too, acquired artifacts of great power. The sorcerer obtained a mysterious box and a decanter that could produce an endless torrent of hot water, its magical properties defying the very laws of nature. The rogue, ever resourceful and cunning, came into possession of a lunchbox of endless bread - a seemingly innocuous item that promised sustenance and nourishment without end.</p>"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%20L%20%287.22%29/L3.04/","title":"Chapter 15: Beyond the Mirror","text":"<p>Session Notes: Beyond the Magic Mirror</p> <p>End of Session</p>"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%20L%20%287.22%29/L3.05/","title":"Chapter 16: In Goth, Gold","text":"<p>Goth'ar'giglas - Massive dwarven city inside the volcano of Dur, surrounded by a sinkhole. - Ruled by Baron Lucious D'Nite, a brutal man suspected of embezzlement. - Prosperous mines and skilled craftsmen. - City is run by a parliament of 14, overseen by the High King. - Food produced in greenhouses and mushroom farms, with feasts held four times a year. - Visitors treated like royalty, payment considered an insult.</p> <p>Summary:  The party left Wonderland enriched by their unique experiences and full of newfound treasures.

It quickly became apparent that the king was likely attempting to clear out some of his long-forgotten storage spaces, for the crates contained an eclectic mix of items ranging from junk and garbage to priceless treasures. As they rummaged through the crates, the players marveled at the assortment before them. There were finely crafted pieces of furniture, horse-drawn carriages, and suits of armor, interspersed with age-old wheels of cheese and bottles of wine. Glinting among the oddities were precious gemstones, their facets catching the torchlight just so. Emboldened by their newfound wealth, the players decided to organize a caravan to traverse the vast expanse of the Grand Desert. They hired help, procured supplies, and set forth on a dusty, sun-baked journey towards the city of Morath-dor, the capital of the goblin financial empire.</p>"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%20L%20%287.22%29/L5.01/","title":"Chapter 27: Act 5 - Battle against the Modron Army","text":"<p>I.

They knew that the task ahead would not be easy, but they were determined to honor the memory of the Nethrael and restore balance to Darkmoon Vale.</p> <p>Lord Valerian Darkmoor, a wise and respected vampire lord, took it upon himself to convene the first official meeting of the Council. He sent out invitations to the representatives of the other six tribes, requesting their presence at his grand castle in the heart of the Underworld.</p> <p>As the council members of Darkmoon Vale gathered, representatives from each of the seven factions took their place at the table. Among them were:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Lord Valerian Darkmoor a figure of complexity and contradiction, embodying the duality of his alignment. He was a force to be reckoned with, a leader who would stop at nothing to protect the world he held dear.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chief Grommok, the mighty orc chieftain, stood tall and proud, his warpaint symbolizing his fierce loyalty to his tribe. Known for their strength and ferocity in battle, the orcs were a force to be reckoned with, and Grommok represented their interests on the council.</p> </li> <li> <p>High King Durin Stonebeard, the wise and stoic dwarf leader, brought with him centuries of knowledge and craftsmanship. The dwarves were renowned for their expertise in mining and forging, and Durin's presence ensured that their voice would be heard in matters of trade and economy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sultan Azim al-Rashid, the enigmatic djinn ruler, exuded an air of mystery and power. The djinn possessed ancient knowledge of magic and were known for their ability to grant wishes. Azim's presence on the council ensured that the magical arts were represented and respected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kalinda Moonshadow, the graceful elven bard, radiated an aura of ethereal beauty and wisdom. The elves were deeply connected to nature and possessed a profound understanding of its intricate balance. Elysia's role was to safeguard the natural world and ensure that the council's decisions did not harm the delicate ecosystems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Walthar Leafblade, the enigmatic necromancer, brought with him a deep understanding of the dark arts. While many feared and mistrusted necromancers, Walthar sought to dispel the misconceptions and prove that their magic could be harnessed for the greater good. His presence on the council represented the pursuit of knowledge and the preservation of ancient secrets.</p> </li> <li> <p>High Chancellor Marcus Valerius, the charismatic and influential human diplomat, was respected by all for his ability to navigate the complex political landscape of Molderia. Representing the various human tribes scattered across the continent, Marcus was skilled in negotiation and compromise, ensuring that the human voice was heard in the council's deliberations.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Together, these representatives formed the Council of Seven, each bringing their unique strengths, perspectives, and agendas to the table. Bound by a common goal to restore balance and honor the memory of the Nethrael, they embarked on a journey that would shape the destiny of Darkmoon Vale for generations to come.</p> <p>As the representatives arrived one by one, they were greeted by Lord Valerian, a regal figure with a commanding presence. The castle's halls were adorned with ancient tapestries and artifacts, a testament to the rich history of the vampire lineage. The atmosphere was tense, as each representative knew that they were about to embark on a journey that would shape the future.</p> <p>The council chamber was a grand hall, with a long table at its center. Each representative took their seat, their eyes filled with determination and curiosity. Lord Valerian stood at the head of the table, his voice resonating with authority as he addressed the gathering.</p> <p>\"My esteemed colleagues,\" he began, his voice carrying a sense of gravitas. \"We stand here today as the chosen few, entrusted with the task of restoring balance to our land. The Nethrael paid a heavy price for their thirst for power, and it is our duty to learn from their mistakes and prevent such a catastrophe from happening again.\"</p> <p>He continued, recounting the events of the meeting, emphasizing the importance of unity and cooperation. He spoke of the need to respect the delicate balance of power and to work towards a future where all tribes could coexist harmoniously, and prevent the wrath of abusing the magic granted by the Old Ones.</p> <p>The representatives listened intently, their eyes locked on Lord Valerian. They understood the gravity of the situation and the responsibility that had been placed upon their shoulders. Each of them had their own reasons for joining the Council, but they all shared a common goal \u2013 to ensure the survival of their world.</p> <p>As the meeting progressed, the representatives began to voice their concerns and ideas. The orc chieftain spoke of the need for a fair distribution of resources, while the dwarf king emphasized the importance of maintaining the integrity of the land. The djinn representative spoke of the need for balance in the use of magic, while the elven ambassador stressed the importance of preserving the natural world. The necromancer representative, though met with skepticism, argued for the understanding and acceptance of the Narrative, highlighting its potential for healing and protection.</p> <p>With the founding principles established, the Council of Seven was born. Lord Valerian, as the eldest and most respected member, was appointed as the first Chancellor, responsible for guiding the Council's decisions and ensuring its unity.</p> <p>Over the years, Valerian tirelessly worked to unite the council members under a common purpose. He understood that their individual strengths and realms of influence could be harnessed to create a formidable force against the goblin banking guild. Valerian forged alliances, negotiated treaties, and navigated the treacherous waters of politics, all the while keeping the true intentions of the council hidden from prying eyes.</p> <p>As the council grew in power and influence, Valerian began to recruit individuals who shared his vision. He sought out those who had been oppressed by the flegdeling goblin banking guild, promising them a chance to rise above their circumstances and be part of something greater. </p> <p>Together, Valerian and his recruits formed a secret network within the council, operating under the guise of various legitimate enterprises. Valerian was careful to maintain the delicate balance of power within the council, ensuring that their actions remained covert and did not provoke open conflict.</p>"},{"location":"The%20World/Tales%20from%20the%20Jorgenvault/A%20Pact%20for%20Balance/#502-years-ago-1987-ad","title":"(502 years ago = 1987 AD)","text":"<p>As the years passed, the Council of Seven became a force to be reckoned with.

The cosmic retribution of the Deucenium Impact had transformed the continent, suppressing natural magic and replacing it with its own unique energies. The races of Molderia struggled to adapt to this new reality, searching for answers and a way to harness again the old power that once flowed freely through their veins.</p> <p>In the heart of the Jungle of Mogolo, a group of intrepid explorers embarked on a perilous journey. Led by the renowned scholar, Professor Arden, they sought to uncover the secrets hidden within the depths of the land. Their quest led them to the ruins of an ancient temple, long forgotten and buried beneath layers of time.</p> <p>As they ventured deeper into the temple's labyrinthine corridors, the air grew heavy with anticipation. The flickering torchlight cast eerie shadows on the walls, revealing intricate carvings and symbols that spoke of a forgotten era. It was in the heart of the temple that they discovered a hidden chamber, its entrance guarded by a massive stone door.</p> <p>With great effort, the explorers managed to pry open the door, revealing a sight that took their breath away. The chamber was bathed in a soft green glow, emanating from dozens of golf ball-sized gemstones scattered across the floor. The gems were unlike anything they had ever seen before, their vibrant green hues mesmerizing and otherworldly.</p> <p>Professor Arden's eyes widened with excitement as he realized the significance of their discovery. \"These are Deucienium gems,\" he exclaimed, his voice filled with awe. \"Legends speak of their existence, but to see them with my own eyes... It is truly remarkable.\"</p> <p>The explorers cautiously approached the gems, their hands trembling with anticipation. They knew that these gems held immense power, the remnants of the cosmic energy that had reshaped their world. Each gem had the ability to grant a small portion of the power of the Old Ones to its user, but at a great cost\u2014the gem would be destroyed in the process.</p> <p>One by one, the explorers reached out and grasped a gem, their bodies tingling with newfound energy. They felt a surge of power coursing through their veins, a connection to the ancient forces that once ruled Molderia. The gems pulsed with a vibrant green light, as if acknowledging their chosen wielders.</p> <p>But as the power surged through them, the gems began to crack and crumble, disintegrating into dust. The explorers watched in awe and sadness as the gems sacrificed themselves, their power transferred to their chosen wielders.</p> <p>With the power of the Old Ones now coursing through their veins, the explorers felt a renewed sense of purpose and determination. They knew that they had been chosen to carry on the legacy of the Azlanti and Nethrael, to protect Molderia from the encroaching darkness.</p> <p>Professor Arden, his eyes shining with newfound knowledge, turned to his companions. \"We must use this power wisely,\" he said, his voice filled with conviction. \"We are the guardians of Molderia, entrusted with the responsibility to ensure its survival.

From his distant planet of Carcosa, he observed the re-awakening of Molderia's power with great interest.

The magic that once flowed freely from our land has grown weak, and our connection with nature has waned.

Our studies indicate that the Nethrael, with their deep understanding of magic, might hold the key to restoring the balance.</p> <p>Council Member 2: But what about the disappearance of our brethren, the Nethrael? Their absence has left a void in our society. We must uncover the truth behind their vanishing.</p> <p>King Alarion: (nodding solemnly) Indeed, the Nethrael were once our greatest allies and guardians of Darkmoon Vale. Their disappearance remains a mystery, and we must find answers. I have summoned the Scholar of Azlants to shed light on this matter.</p> <p>*Scholar of Azlant 2 steps forward, holding a scroll.</p> <p>Scholar of Azlant 2: Your Majesty, we have delved into ancient texts and prophecies, seeking clues to the fate of the Nethrael. Our research has revealed a tale of great power and tragedy.</p> <p>Council Member 3: Please, enlighten us. We must understand what befell our brethren.</p> <p>Scholar of Azlant 2: According to the prophecies, the Nethrael's thirst for power led them to a forbidden ritual. They sought to tap into the very essence of the ley lines, to wield unmatched magical might. But in their arrogance, they awakened a malevolent force, a being of chaos and destruction.</p> <p>Council Member 4: You speak of Chthulu, the Sleeper Beneath Waves.</p> <p>Scholar of Azlant 2: Yes, Council Member.

Please, tell us what has befallen our brethren.</p> <p>Chthulu: (his voice reverberating through the hall) Long ago, the Nethrael possessed a deep connection with the ley lines that run through this land. They harnessed the power of the ley lines to weave their magic and maintain balance. But their power grew too great, and their ambitions led them to seek even greater dominion over the forces of magic. The Nethrael's insatiable hunger for power led them to tamper with forces they could not control. They delved too deep into the ley lines, awakening ancient and malevolent entities. In their arrogance, they awoke me, the Sleeper Beneath Waves, to aid them in their quest.</p> <p>King Alarion: (realizing the consequences) They were blind to the consequences of their actions. </p> <p>Chthulu: (his eyes glowing with an eerie intensity) The unleashed chaos consumed the Nethrael Kingdom. The Nethrael, consumed by their own ambition, vanished, their existence erased from this realm.</p> <p>*Flashback (2489 years ago = 0 AD)</p> <pre><code>Nethrael High Priest stands before the Nethrael Council, holding a crystal staff.\n\nNethrael High Priest: (addressing the council) My brethren, I have discovered a way to tap into the very heart of the ley lines, to unlock unimaginable power. With this staff, we can reshape the world to our liking.\n\nCouncil Member 3: But High Priest, such power comes at a great cost. We risk losing ourselves to darkness and chaos.\n\nNethrael High Priest: (with determination) The risk is worth it. We must seize this opportunity and secure our place as the most powerful beings in Darkmoon Vale.\n\nCouncil Member 4: (hesitant) But Lord, we Nethrael have always been stewards of balance and harmony. This path we tread is dangerous. We must consider the consequences.\n\nNethrael High Priest: (dismissively) Consequences are for the weak-minded. We have the knowledge and the power to control the very essence of magic. We will not be bound by limitations any longer.\n\nCouncil Member 5: (pleading) My Lord, I implore you to reconsider. The ley lines are a delicate network that connects all living beings. To tamper with them so recklessly could have dire consequences for Darkmoon Vale and its inhabitants.\n\nNethrael High Priest: (angered) Are you questioning my authority, Council Member? I am the Speaker of this Tribe, and it is my duty to lead our people to greatness.

I am but a mortal speck in the vastness of the universe.\"</p> <p>Cthulhu's eyes, filled with an otherworldly glow, peered down at Walthar, seemingly indifferent to his concerns. And yet, there was a glimmer of something resembling amusement flickering in those depths.</p> <p>\"You possess a rare quality, Walthar Leafblade,\" Cthulhu rumbled, his voice echoing in Walthar's mind. \"A thirst for knowledge and a drive to understand the unfathomable. I have chosen you to carry on the work we have begun here. With the power I bestow upon you, you shall shape the narrative that will ultimately lead to the downfall of Hastur.\"</p> <p>Walthar's mind whirled with the implications of Cthulhu's words.

Through your written words, you shall shape the hearts and minds of future generations, guiding them towards the path that will ultimately seal Hastur's fate.\"</p> <p>Walthar's eyes widened in awe and realization. He had always been fond of books and the written word, but now he understood the true power they held. With each page he crafted, with each story he spun, he would be sowing the seeds of Hastur's downfall.</p> <p>And so, Cthulhu bestowed upon Walthar the ancient and forbidden knowledge required to navigate the currents of time and space. He gifted him a powerful artifact, a quill imbued with the very essence of his being, that would aid him in his task. Walthar's mind flooded with visions of battles fought, realms traversed, and ancient secrets uncovered. The weight of his newfound power settled upon his shoulders.</p> <p>\"I shall not fail you, Great Cthulhu,\" Walthar declared, a fire igniting within his eyes. \"I will dedicate my life to unraveling the mysteries of the universe, to crafting a narrative that will bring about the demise of Hastur.\"</p> <p>Cthulhu's towering form seemed to nod in approval, a strange sense of satisfaction emanating from his presence.</p> <p>\"Your journey begins now, Walthar Leafblade,\" Cthulhu intoned, his voice resonating with an ominous finality. \"May the touch of my power guide your hand and lead you to victory.\"</p> <p>And with that, Cthulhu retreated into the depths of the sea, leaving Walthar alone with his thoughts and the vast expanse of possibilities that lay before him.
